Signals,Municipality of Zundert,public space reports,No,Space and Infrastructure,Melding maken - gemeente Zundert,In use," If something needs to be fixed or cleaned up on the street or in a park, it can be reported to the municipality through SIA, the online reporting system. A dangerous traffic situation or nuisance from people and catering establishments can also be reported. Previously, people had to choose which category their report fit best (e.g. 'nuisance' or 'street furniture'), so that the report went to the right department in the municipality. But the municipality is a complex organisation and the list of categories is long. As a result, people did not always choose the right category. This sometimes caused delays in processing notifications. Therefore, we now use an algorithm that recognises words, e.g. 'rubbish' and 'pavement'. Based on this, it determines which category the report best fits and which department should handle it. So the caller no longer has to choose a category, and the call is handled faster because it goes to the right department.","vendor-independent, common ground principle ",,,0.4.0,,,gemeente@zundert.nl,NLD,,"NotificationsThe dataset consists of notifications made previously (free text field). Initially, we used 30,000 notifications from past years to train the algorithm. It is regularly retrained with new notifications and implemented corrections to existing notifications. If the KCC or the service department see an incorrect categorisation, (see Human monitoring) they correct it manually in the notification system. These corrections are used in retraining. We are investigating whether re-training the algorithm can be automated in the future.We cannot disclose this dataset in this register. Because the data comes from a free text field, it may contain personal data, although this is explicitly not requested.Email address and telephone number for follow-up questionsSomeone making a report can leave his or her telephone number and/or email address if he or she wishes. We will then keep the reporter informed of progress and have the option of calling him or her back. This information is not kept longer than necessary for this purpose and is therefore not used by the algorithm."," Architecture of the model  The text of the notification is divided into individual words. Each word from a notification is analysed to see how unique it is to that notification, set against the total collection of words ('TF-IDF' or 'term frequency-inverse document frequency'). As a result, a word like 'the' or 'thank you' gets a low weight and a word like 'rubbish' gets a higher weight. From that combination of words, logistic regression (a machine-learning technique) is then used to determine which category the report belongs to and thus which department within the municipality the report is most likely to fit.", All reports categorised with less than 40% certainty are forwarded to the KCC. A human assessment then takes place and the call is still categorised. Reports that are wrongly forwarded to an incorrect category are also manually placed in the correct category by the responsible department (sometimes via the KCC).," There are few risks in this algorithm. It places a notification in the right category and ensures that it comes to the attention of the right department faster. If the algorithm cannot place a notification in a category with sufficient certainty, it ends up in the 'Other' category. KCC staff review those notifications and manually put them in the right category. If the algorithm does not work properly, it therefore takes a little longer for the report to reach the right department. The reporter can add personal data if he or she wants to be kept informed. This data is stored securely and not used by the algorithm.",VNG,,,01-2023,,,Data protection impact assessment (DPIA),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Profile (CJIB) Undeliverable return (OBR) National Approach to Address Quality (LAA),National Office for Identity Data,The OBR profile concerns cases where the Central Judicial Collection Agency (CJIB) has reasonable doubt about the accuracy of address details in the Basic Registration of Persons (BRP). Part of the National Approach to Address Quality (LAA).,No,"Board, Service delivery",https://www.rvig.nl/brp/landelijke-aanpak-adreskwaliteit-laa,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm is to select potential high-risk addresses based on reasonable doubt and provide them to municipalities for further address searches. Based on these address searches, incorrect address data are corrected, so that government bodies using data from the BRP can perform their public duties based on accurate information. In addition, address research can provide insight into social problems; a home visit is the moment when debts or social problems can become visible. ","The accuracy of (address) data in the BRP is essential for the functioning of the Dutch government. A government that does not know or does not know how to find its citizens is unable to perform the tasks entrusted to it by its citizens. In many cases, it is a precondition for the correct implementation of legal regulations and for the effectiveness of government policies. For citizens, proper registration is important for their correspondence with the government and for claiming address-related government services. Regulations explicitly state which data may be used in the algorithm. Thus, data that is not mentioned may not be used. Also, no (personal) data that could lead to discrimination is used. No selection is made based on nationality, place of birth or derivatives thereof. Using the algorithm is a cost-effective way of securing and improving the quality of the BRP. Using the algorithm, you can prioritise addresses where there is a greater than 50 per cent chance that something is wrong in the registration and at the same time ensure that you do not visit citizens unnecessarily. There is no automatic decision-making with this algorithm; there is always human intervention by the municipal official.","The minister's authority to process personal data necessary for the development and deployment of signals for address research is laid down in Section 2.37a of the Personal Data (Basic Registration) Act. 
The Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations has the possibility to designate by ministerial regulation (article 19a ff.) administrative bodies and third parties to send the notification of reasonable doubt about the correctness of an address data to the minister instead of to the board. The minister may analyse these return notifications, and from this analysis a signal may arise that there is suspicion that the registration of persons at an address is incorrect. This signal is forwarded by the minister to a college. 
The information from the feedbacks is an important source in the development of signals. The BRP Decree, Article 28b sets out detailed rules on the content of feedback notifications from administrative bodies to the minister. In a feedback notification, discrepancies are reported between, on the one hand, data provided from the BRP and, on the other hand, data of which the administrative body has become aware by other means. The administrative body hereby reports the grounds for its doubts about the accuracy of the address data. The grounds for doubt concern data that support the feedback, in that these data, taken together, say something about occupancy at a particular address. In this case, the fact that a letter was returned undeliverable. 
The categories of personal data (Decree article 28a ev.) that may be processed by the minister are detailed in lower regulations and the ministerial regulation describes the profiles (article 19a, second paragraph, annex 9a) of designated administrative bodies that are currently used by the minister.

The selection rules are determined on the basis of analyses and domain knowledge within RvIG in consultation with municipalities. Data pre-selected by CJIB are used in RvIG's algorithm as input data. Addresses selected by this algorithm are sent to municipalities. Municipalities can decide for each address whether an address search should be carried out and to what extent: no address search, only a preliminary search or a preliminary search followed by a home visit.","The profile is regularly evaluated with the eye of RvIG and municipalities on whether it still works, needs to be adjusted or has lost its effectiveness and should no longer be used. In this way, efforts are made to minimise the privacy impact on Dutch citizens. There is no automatic decision-making. Algorithms are a tool and are not leading.

Performance monitor,Inspectorate of Education,"This algorithm creates a risk sorting of educational institutions (schools, courses or school boards) to conduct targeted desk research, as part of the annual performance and risk analysis.

From the guarantee function of supervision, the inspectorate ensures that the Education Act (and the regulations based on it) are complied with. This is about what the board and the school/college all have to do. Because of this safeguarding function, every year we map out whether there are educational institutions with risks. Because there are very many schools, study programmes and boards in the Netherlands, we do this check partly automatically. To do this, we use an algorithm: the algorithm calculates a risk score for each educational institution. Based on the risk sorting made by the algorithm, manual desk analyses are performed. For the desk analysis, analysts and/or inspectors look at the data used for the algorithm, but also at other things, such as a school guide, for example, or specific reports (e.g. a concerned parent who contacted the inspectorate). If, based on the manual analysis, inspectors think the risks are high and serious, the school or board will be contacted. Inspectors may then also conduct an on-site investigation at the school, programme, or board.","The advantage of using an algorithm that calculates risk is that not all institutions need to be examined manually every year. Manual analysis costs a lot of time and money. By examining the institutions with a high risk score manually, analysts and inspectors can be deployed where they are needed most. A disadvantage could be that the algorithm would only show schools at risk in subjects the inspectorate has data on. To prevent the inspectorate from only looking at data, analysts and inspectors always have the option of performing additional desk analyses. For example, for educational institutions they do have concerns about, even if that institution does not have a high risk score.","WOT, WVO, WPO, WEC, WEB, WHW, AWB, WOB",,0.4.0,,,https://contactformulier.onderwijsinspectie.nl/contact,,,"The main sources of information are pupil numbers, staff characteristics, financial characteristics of the institutions, learning outcomes and signals (from parents and pupils who contact us).

The rules are set with the help of inspectors and analysts, and based on quantitative research.","The outcome of the algorithm is a risk score. Educational institutions with a high risk score receive a manual desk analysis. In addition, inspectors or analysts can also conduct manual desk analyses for institutions they have concerns about even if that institution has a low risk score. If the desk analysis shows that the risks are high and serious, the institution is contacted and other supervisory activities may follow. Sometimes this means an on-site inspection visit. The desk analysis and any on-site investigation are carried out entirely by people.","If risk estimation is found to have insufficient predictive power, then certain institutions may be examined unnecessarily. The time of analysts and inspectors is then not used in the right places (inefficient). Institutions that do have problems may then be left out of the picture.Even more specifically: if certain groups of schools are disproportionately (disproportionately to the actual risks) represented in the high-risk groups, these institutions may be unnecessarily burdened. Even then, there is inefficient use of capacity, and unfair burden on certain schools or boards. Because institutions with higher risk scores are investigated more often, incorrect risk estimation can also continue (tunnel vision). Perfect risk estimation is impossible. To keep risk estimation as good as possible, annual assessments of the quality of risk estimation of the Performance Monitor are carried out. This allows us to visualise the extent to which the final human assessment has deviated from the algorithm's risk estimate. We use these outcomes to make annual adjustments to the model.

Using fingerprints for identity verification together with facial comparison is an appropriate way to establish a person's identity. It reduces the susceptibility to fraud, allowing us to better secure travel documents. ","The legal basis for both the first and second cases lie in Regulation (EC) 2252/2004* and Regulation (EU) 2019/1157** . These regulations stipulate, among other things, that the fingerprints to be included in passports, travel documents and identity cards can only be used to verify: a) the authenticity of the document and b) the identity of the holder. The provisions are anchored in national legislation, namely in Section 3 of the Passport Act in conjunction with the regulations below: 1. With regard to the first case in which the algorithm is used (quality comparison), Article 28a of the Passport Implementation Regulations Netherlands 2001 describes the manner in which the fingerprints of the applicant for a travel document are recorded and in which cases this may be waived. The quality of the recorded fingerprint(s) is crucial therein (paragraph 2-3)*** 2. That the algorithm can be deployed for identity verification upon issue is articulated in Article 4.6 of the Passport Decree. With the deployment of the algorithm, biometric data and thus special personal data are processed within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (AVG).  In principle, the AVG prohibits the processing of special personal data. However, the national legislator has used the space for member states to create exemptions for processing special personal data for reasons of public interest (Article 9(2) AVG). Article 29 of the AVG Implementation Act allows processing of biometric data for the purpose of unique identification if the processing is necessary for authentication and security purposes * Article 4(3) of Council Regulation (EC) 2252/2004 of 13 December 2004 on standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by Member States.

The selection rule was as follows: - Class 1 consists of images with NFIQ 1.0 value 1 (with activation score &gt; 0.7) and true score in the 90th percentile for each of the NFIQ 2 providers. 
- Class 0 consists of images with an NFIQ 1.0 value of 5 (with activation score &gt; 0.9) and a true score less than a threshold corresponding to a false match rate of 1 in 10,000, i.e. false rejection at a false match rate of 0.0001.

NFIQ 2 software produces a quality score consistent with the international fingerprint quality standard ISO/IEC 29794-1:2016 is in (0-100), where 0 means no utility value and 100 is the highest utility value. NFIQ 2 uses a random forest model to classify the data. NFIQ 2 is a binary classifier. Scores are derived from the random forest decision. Each decision tree uses a random subset of the feature vector. When using 100 decision trees, each vote is one score point. The distribution of votes/score points is non-linear, and not necessarily uncorrelated. NFIQ 2 uses 69 features manually selected and validated.","If the index finger is injured or missing, we will take a fingerprint from another finger (the middle finger, ring finger or thumb).

The purpose of the e-services with the underlying algorithm is to provide maximum support/ guidance to residents and entrepreneurs when submitting a digital application. As a result, this application can be submitted correctly and completely. The algorithm checks various details of the resident. If no details are found in the application or declaration, it can be processed without the intervention of a civil affairs officer.If one or more peculiarities are found, the application/declaration always enters a work list. There it is checked by a civil affairs employee. The algorithm can only automatically approve an application/declaration. Only the civil affairs officer can reject an application/declaration.

Impact
The impact is that such an application can be dealt with efficiently by the municipality; after all, citizens/companies have already carried out various steps (work), leaving the officer more time for the special and/or complicated declarations/applications the municipality receives. In some cases, this application can even be processed fully automatically. The quality of service goes up because of these services, as does the quality of the data in the BRP.
","Handling all applications through the counter is no longer an option for municipalities. This is due to numbers and time constraints. An algorithm offers residents and entrepreneurs guidance with (digital) applications. A municipality can choose to submit every digital application to the civil affairs officer for assessment before it is processed. For people who are not or less digitally literate, there is always the option of submitting the application via the municipal counter.","

","Performance of government task (Art. 6(1)(e) AVG, Art. 2(2) Kingdom Act)",non-public,0.4.0,,niet openbaar,DCV-BAO@minbuza.nl,EN,,"Support using the algorithm is provided in two ways: 1) the application is compared with the available data (from BZ and information received from the migration chain) and 2) the application is compared with similar applications from the past (using profiles). The outcome of this comparison is an advice to the decision officer handling the application, and provides additional insight when estimating the intensity of the preliminary examination of the visa application.The data used are the following: (1) information provided by the applicant himself from the application form submitted to BZ; (2) information from the sponsor and/or employer; (3) information from the migration chain (see under 'data sources); and (4) profile information based on similar past applications. For a complete overview of data, see also the factsheet https://www.nederlandwereldwijd.nl/binaries/content/assets/pdfs-nederlands/factsheet-informatie-ondersteund-beslissen-visum-kort-verblijf-kvv-maart-2023.pdf","Comparison with the data present is done through the so-called hit/no hit principle. If there is information about the applicant, the sponsor or the employer in the BZ database, there is a hit. There is therefore a match between the information entered on the application form and the information known to BZ from the database. In addition, the application is compared with the profiles present. Here too, the hit/no hit principle is used. Here, the characteristics of the profile are compared with the specific characteristics from the application form. For example, the purpose of travel and the place where the visa application was submitted. When there is a match between the characteristics from the profiles and the application form, there is a hit. A profile is set of characteristics established after an analysis of historical data available at BZ. It is not a personal profile that says something about an individual, but about a similar (large) group of visa applicants. Profiles are established by BZ after careful analysis. For instance, profiles must meet various conditions before they are deployed by BZ.The algorithm is classified as a classification system and works on the basis of predetermined simple 'if-then rules'.",It is and remains up to the decision-maker to decide the next step in the application and whether a visa is ultimately granted or refused. There is thus (meaningful) human intervention.  ,Final decisions on an application are monitored by BZ. These decisions are compared with the supporting advice given by the algorithm. This monitors whether decision-makers do not 'blind' to the algorithm's treatment advice by automatically basing an approval or a rejection on it. ,Internally developed,"Schengen visa, Short-stay visa, KVV, EU visa code",Niet open source,"2017

Risk model sales decline NOW,Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment,"The risk model (the algorithm) helps choose which NOW applications to investigate further. It gives clues as to whether the information given in the NOW application is correct. With these indications from the risk model, SZW reviews the application.",No,Work,,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm (the risk model) is to support the Ministry of SZW in choosing which NOW applications should be further investigated for the accuracy of the declared turnover loss.  The risk model compares information provided by the applicant in the NOW application with information from public sources and with information from other government organisations. A very large number of NOW applications have been submitted. By using the risk model, choices can be made faster. As a result, employers receive a decision as soon as possible.The impact for the vast majority of applicants is that they quickly receive a decision on their NOW application without the need for further investigation. For those applicants who do get selected, this means that partly with the help of the risk model, the stated loss of turnover will be investigated further. If a NOW application is investigated then it takes longer to make a decision than if a NOW application is not investigated.  Ultimately, the investigation may reveal a different turnover loss percentage than the applicant submitted in the NOW application. As a result, the final grant amount may differ from the grant amount the applicant expected based on the NOW application."," Advantages:  Scale; Almost half a million applications have been submitted, spread over eight different rounds. If the ministry were to check all these NOW applications, it takes a lot of time and a lot of money. By selecting NOW applications for scrutiny using the risk model, we keep costs as low as possible for everyone: for employers, but also for the government.    Efficient working method; With the use of the algorithm (risk model), the working method is efficiently designed. The risk model helps staff make effective and accurate choices based on objective information. As a result, the vast majority of applicants quickly receive a decision without the need for further investigation. In this way, large numbers of applications can be quickly fed back to UWV.  Standardised working method; the Ministry of SZW uses information from other public sources for the risk model. This is information from, for example, the Chamber of Commerce about the start of the business and who owns it. This objective information is used in the risk model. With this, the risk model helps staff make choices based on objective information and comparisons.  DisadvantagesThe risk model gives an indication of whether the stated turnover loss from a NOW application is correct. This indication is based on information from public sources and information from other government organisations. The model cannot take into account every unique situation that may apply to an employer. As a result, it does not always accurately reflect reality. Staff take this into account and therefore review NOW applications designated by the model at the individual level.  On the one hand, it happens that NOW applications are selected, but the examination does not reveal any inaccuracies. For these applicants, there is a longer processing time and an additional administrative burden. This is because the applicant has to prove that the information given in the NOW application is correct using data from records. On the other hand, not all possible risks are included in the risk model. This may result in incorrect NOW applications not being examined.

Police can be extra active in those boxes (see ""technical operation"") and at those times.","The advantage of CAS is that people and resources can be used more effectively to enhance security. A disadvantage is that CAS is based on reports and notifications from citizens. If no crime reports or notifications have been made, it does not always mean that no additional police deployment is needed.The deployment of CAS is justified because CAS provides important information for the police. But the results of CAS are not the only way to determine what police deployment is needed.

Of these compartments, using historical police records, the following is calculated:how many incidents of a particular type of crime occurred in or around the compartment in a 12-week period;how many known suspects of that type of crime lived in the vicinity of the compartment during this period. With these indicators, CAS can build an expectation for the boxes. This is done by a combined logistic regression model. That model is able to estimate the probability of an incident of a particular type of crime occurring in the near future based on the indicators mentioned above.Using the indicators mentioned above and the logistic regression model, a police team can see in which boxes and at what times there is an increased risk of a particular type of crime. These boxes are then displayed on a map. A police team can request images of up to four types of crime to depict on a CAS map. ","Staff at the so-called information hub of a police team process CAS outcomes, also using other police information.

Control removals,Municipality of Dongen,"The Insight module checks online relocation declarations for the municipality. Using smart checks, the module determines which declarations have no peculiarities and which give cause for further investigation.",No,Service delivery,https://www.dongen.nl/over-deze-website,In use,"
As soon as an online move is received, the Insight Module checks whether the declaration contains any anomalous properties. Are there no peculiarities? Then the move is processed automatically. Do the module checks produce a signal? Then the module makes the declaration ready for the civil servant in the Centric Burgerzaken waiting room. There, the official assesses whether additional questions or investigations are required. If the conclusion is that the declaration is in order, the official processes it. The Insight module tests the online declarations against the checks of the National Approach to Address Quality (LAA) and checks that officials will recognise from everyday practice. For example, checks for frequent movers, the purpose of use of a property, over-occupancy of an address or an address that is the subject of many removals.

The importance of a correctly registered address goes beyond keeping the Basic Registration of Persons (BRP) in order. If a disaster occurs, for instance, you want to be able to warn everyone in the area in time. As a municipality, you also provide facilities, benefits or subsidies to residents on the basis of the address registered in the BRP. This makes correct address registration important for both residents and government.
 
The algorithm checks various details of the citizen. If no peculiarities are found in the declaration, it can be processed without the intervention of an employee. If a particularity is found, the declaration falls into a waiting room where it is checked by an employee. The algorithm can only automatically approve a declaration. Only the official can reject a declaration.

Case Matcher: A search and find function in asylum applications,IND,Staff processing asylum applications can use this algorithm to search for similar applications to treat applications equally.,No,Migration and Integration,,In use,"Asylum applications should be treated fairly and equally. This algorithm allows the clerk to search and find all similar asylum applications faster. For example, the caseworker searches by year and document type such as application, decision, ruling and client information. Asylum applications that are very similar can thus be treated similarly. The caseworker can also find information needed to process the application faster.","Asylum applications can be processed faster, more fairly and equally if the caseworker can search and find similar asylum applications. This algorithm allows the clerk to search and find more easily, instead of going through previously processed applications piece by piece. Using search terms, a list of documents and asylum applications that have similarities with the search terms appears. The employee chooses from the list and opens the document and/or application to go through the information. The clerk can choose to copy, for example, the legal grounds on which an application has been approved or rejected in the past. This may allow the employee to process the application faster.",,,0.4.0,,,Algoritmeregister@ind.nl,NLD,,"The algorithm searches a database of asylum applications and relevant documents such as appeals. For example, the clerk can search by: case number, document type, country of origin, nationality, gender or year. ","
The algorithm determines the relevance of documents and asylum applications eligible to be searched and found through that finding system. The relevance is determined in 2 steps:

1. The employee can filter in the main screen by, for example, year and nationality (which is a highly relevant variable in an asylum application) and can search by terms. These search terms are then searched in the filtered documents and the documents where they occur (whether in combination or not) come up in a list. This list of documents is ordered by relevance; the higher, the more (possibly) relevant these documents are. This relevance score is determined by standard search algorithms. A document is ranked higher if terms occur more often and also in combination with each other. The employee can then check the documents themselves to see if they are relevant to the case to be handled.

2. The employee can also choose to have the found documents aggregated (merged) at case level. The documents that were filtered and in which the search terms came up are now listed per asylum application and presented in a table. Now the employee does not see a list of documents but a list of asylum applications, and again, the higher the asylum application is in the list, the more relevant it may be. In this case, relevance is determined by a scoring mechanism based on document type.

With the help of experts, it was determined that some documents are more important than others. Consider an asylum narrative (which describes the story of the asylum seeker) or a document summarising the asylum application. In the overview of asylum applications, the employee can quickly see in which documents the search terms occurred.
","The caseworker searches for words and gets a list of all documents and asylum applications that contain these words. The caseworker reviews the list and assesses whether it contains relevant information to process the application. Due to changes in policy, a previous decision on an asylum application may no longer fit the current policy. The caseworker is obliged to decide based on the policy currently in force. Incidentally, each new asylum application is always read and assessed by several experts.","Only employees with permission have access to this algorithm. Employees must also undergo training before they can use this algorithm; this is part of internal IND training. This training explains how the employee can and may use this search and find function. For example, the employee is not allowed to search on persons (names). The IND is bound by privacy regulations under the AVG. This means that documents and applications may not be viewed just like that. The employee himself is always the expert and the decision-maker (and not the algorithm). The employee may not judge solely on the results of the algorithm, but must always take into account the current policy, applicable instructions and current events.With experts, which documents are relevant in an asylum application are assessed in advance.

A score indicating how likely you are to find work within a year.
A personal overview of your chances on the labour market. This also shows what you could improve to find work faster.


According to the algorithm, do you have less than a 50% chance of finding a job again within 12 months? Then we will invite you for an interview earlier. A UWV employee will then work with you to see how we can help you. The employee can use the personal overview of your talents and skills for this purpose.

You haven't heard from us, but would like advice? Even then you can always request an interview.
","UWV employees monitor the use of the algorithm in the following ways: 

We regularly check whether the algorithm uses the correct data. 
We always discuss with you whether the results of the Work Explorer are correct. If you made a mistake when completing the questionnaire, you can discuss it with a staff member. You can also complete the questionnaire again at any time. 
The UWV employee decides together with you what you need to find work. So the algorithm does not make any decisions itself.

We ensure that we remain compliant with information security and privacy requirements. We do this in the following ways: 

We continuously work on algorithm maintenance. 
We delete data that is not (or no longer) important. 
We have other organisations check our compliance with legal and ethical standards.
An external and independent organisation carries out quality checks to test whether the algorithm is careful. This is in addition to the checks that our specialist UWV staff do as standard.

Civil Affairs eServices,Municipality of Rucphen,"Residents of Dutch municipalities can arrange various civil affairs processes digitally. To process simple declarations automatically, the system performs various checks on your recorded data in this Basic Registration.",No,Housing,https://rucphen.nl,In use,"
The calculation model checks your personal data. There are then two possibilities:

1. there is nothing special about it;
2. something special is going on.

If there is something special. the application enters a waiting room. 
From this waiting room, a staff member checks the application. 
 
The calculation model can never reject an application. A staff member rejects it. 

Special circumstances are different for each application. But if, for example, you submitted a change yesterday and submit a change again today, that is grounds for a check.
","
In practice, many applications turn out to be simple and without details. As soon as these applications/declarations are processed automatically, the waiting time for these is reduced. More time will then be left for the special and/or complicated declarations/applications the municipality receives. Complex situations will also be assessed faster and more accurately. 
In both situations, you as a customer will be better served.All this has a positive effect on the quality of the BasisRegistratie Personen (BRP). After all, the BRP is used by many organisations as a source for their own registration.

These requirements are manually checked for compliance, and serve as entry to the shortlist/selection process. For the ranking of the rough lists, Better Performance (formerly Past Performance) is used, which is linked to the national uniform method and database of performance measurement by CROW Better Performance. This involves the performance questionnaires and national enterprise score database. ","The algorithm is a selection system for selecting contractors to be invited for the multiple-negotiated procurement of infrastructure works. The selection system works on the basis of rough lists. A shortlist includes all companies that have applied for the list and meet suitability requirements such as holding a required certificate. A company wants to be asked for works it is good at; Flevoland Province would like to invite companies suitable for the work.

In order to select the right companies, it is important to know the content of the contract. For each work, Flevoland Province determines which wholesale list or (in the case of an integral contract) which combination of wholesale lists, the contract falls within. The contract value is then estimated. On the basis of these rough lists, suitability requirements and contract value, contractors can show interest and thus qualify for an invitation to tender. Of these interested potential contractors, a selection should be made which will actually receive an invitation. To do this in a fair way, a selection system is used that is supported by data from Better Performance. 

Better Performance (formerly Past Performance) Better Performance measures and evaluates the performance during the execution of contracts using CROW, the national uniform method of performance measurement. This performance measurement is carried out using questionnaires that result in a final mark. The higher the final mark, the higher the mark on the ranking of the wholesale list. The ranking per groslist is divided into 'top companies' and 'other companies'. For each wholesale list, Flevoland Province determines how many companies can have a top ranking, which depends on the number of companies on the wholesale list. The maximum number of companies with a top position is about 25% of the total number of companies on the wholesale list. The minimum score for joining the top list is the figure 8. Beginning companies that do not yet have a score, due to not having performed any work yet, are automatically assigned a 7. Depending on the number of companies to be selected, part of the selection is chosen from the top companies and part from the other companies. This way, novice contractors also get a chance to be invited. After the selection system provides a selection, the process is further taken up manually, such as sending the invitations.","Human intervention is used within the process.

It contributes to the province's mobility task. The deployment of iVRIs is also necessary to efficiently perform the task as road manager of provincial roads.
 
The algorithm affects traffic participants (motorists, walkers, cyclists, trucks, public transport, emergency and rescue services, etc) because it determines the colour of the traffic lights and how long each traffic participant has to wait. iVRIs can give a form of priority to traffic participants. For example, when an ambulance arrives urgently but also, for example, to a group of cyclists or a column of trucks.  There are different forms of priority. Absolute priority (cutting off other directions), for example, is used for emergency and emergency services and conditioned priority (the traffic light tries to ""regulate"" towards a road user) in other cases. The province's priority framework and local circumstances determine the degree of priority for each road user.","It is important, because of different interests, to consider when one group of road users has priority over another. This depends on economic reasons (freight priority), the environment (residential area, business park, etc), public transport priority (reducing delays), or necessity (ambulance priority).","

At the heart of iVRIs is the integration of various data sources. These include:
1. Sensors: These are placed at intersections and detect the presence and speed of vehicles.
2. Video cameras: They provide visual data and can be used for object recognition and tracking.
3. Connected vehicles: Modern vehicles often transmit data about their location and speed.
4. Mobile apps: Think of navigation apps that share real-time traffic information.
These data streams are collected and analysed in a central system, where decisions are made about traffic light cycles.
","The method and models have been established nationwide from the Talking Traffic project and are managed by the LVMB.Just as we learn from our experiences, these traffic lights also learn. They use something called ""machine learning"". Usually this is done by a technique called Reinforcement Learning. This means they look at what has happened in the past and learn from that to do better in the future. This way, they get a little smarter every day!
","The algorithm makes real-time independent decisions. There is no ""human in the loop"" for these decisions. The decisions the algorithm makes do fall within criteria specified by humans (e.g.: What is the maximum time a traffic light can remain green)","Traffic safety is controlled: For traffic lights in general, as soon as a traffic unsafe situation may arise (conflicting directions get green), the algorithm will abort and the traffic lights will start flashing. This is because in addition to the 'control algorithm' that controls the traffic lights, there is also a control algorithm. The abort is due to this separate safety-control algorithm. Apart from this, the general traffic law also applies when the traffic lights are 'flashing'.

iCitizenship e-services,Municipality of Lochem,"Residents and entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to apply for citizenship products digitally via the municipal website. To process declarations automatically, the system performs several checks.",No,Service delivery,,In use,"Purpose
The aim of the e-services with the underlying algorithm is to provide maximum support/ guidance to residents and entrepreneurs when submitting a digital application. As a result, this application can be submitted correctly and completely. The algorithm checks various details of the resident. If no details are found in the application or declaration, it can be processed without the intervention of a civil affairs officer.If one or more peculiarities are found, the application/declaration always enters a work list. There it is checked by a civil affairs employee. The algorithm can only automatically approve an application/declaration. Only the civil affairs officer can reject an application/declaration.

Impact
The impact is that such an application can be dealt with efficiently by the municipality; after all, citizens/companies have already completed several steps (work), leaving the officer more time for the special and/or complicated declarations/applications the municipality receives. In some cases, this application can even be processed fully automatically. The quality of service goes up because of these services, as does the quality of the data in the BRP.","Handling all applications through the counter is no longer an option for municipalities. This is due to numbers and time constraints. An algorithm offers residents and entrepreneurs guidance with (digital) applications.

Selection model BIG re-registration ,CIBG,"A healthcare provider applying for BIG re-registration does not always have to substantiate this application with documentary evidence.

On the contrary, those applicants that are likely to comply should be relieved of as much administrative burden as possible. This attempts to meet both the desire for effective protection of patient interests and the interest of professionals to keep the administrative and financial burden on them limited.","
Assigning a risk category by the selection model aims to reduce the administrative burden on healthcare providers and work more on the basis of trust rather than mistrust. Reducing the administrative burden on healthcare providers requires assigning them to risk categories. Reducing the administrative burden is difficult to achieve any other way.

","
The algorithm used in targeted selection is a type of ""decision tree classifier"". It can be seen as a structured method of indicating which applications are likely to be at higher risk of not meeting the legal requirements for re-registration. Each node in this tree represents a specific question about the application, for example the total number of hours worked in the past five years. Based on the answers to these questions, the tree guides the decision across several branches until finally a conclusion is reached: either ""select"" or ""do not select"". In training, the algorithm learns to ask the most informative questions at each step based on the available data in order to divide the applications into smaller and more homogeneous groups.
 
The algorithm offers a choice of 16 different trees. Four different levels in terms of tree depth can be selected (3, 4, 5 or 6) and then the minimum size of the group is determined (100, 200, 300 or 400). Depth refers to the maximum number of splitting or decision steps the tree can have between the root (the start point) and the leaves (the end point). The minimum group size refers to the minimum number of applications for BIG re-registration that must be present on an end leaf of the decision tree.
The algorithm calculates the probability that an application belongs to a certain category, allowing us to classify applications as ""medium risk"" or ""high risk"". Only ""high risk"" applications are selected for verification in the targeted sample. This choice was made to ease the administrative burden on healthcare providers as much as possible ('low or medium risk' applications can still fall into the random sample).","
The selection model determines whether an application is selected for having to provide (objectively verifiable) supporting documents.
The use of the algorithm does not lead to fully automated decision-making. After all, the final substantive assessment of an application based on the evidence provided is done by an employee.","

Preventing direct discrimination - when the files are assessed by the algorithm, no sensitive file characteristics (such as gender, age or having a foreign nationality) are shared on which the algorithm could make a direct distinction. As these are not included as file characteristics, the algorithm cannot select on these either. Moreover, these characteristics are also not included as relevant criteria in the decision trees. This is to prevent direct discrimination on these characteristics; 
Preventing indirect discrimination - although the decision tree cannot select directly on sensitive file characteristics, it is theoretically possible that a certain - seemingly innocent - characteristic is included in the tree, which has the practical effect that certain groups of healthcare providers are more likely to receive a high risk score. This is prohibited when there is no justification for doing so. During the development of the algorithm, this was considered and it was decided to show 'bias graphs' on the dashboard for the generated decision trees and the current decision tree, showing whether, as a result of a decision tree, certain groups of healthcare providers are selected relatively more often than other groups of healthcare providers. This is made transparent for the following characteristics: age, gender and having or not having a foreign nationality. Based on these bias graphs, a tree with the lowest possible bias or a tree where the indirect bias is objectively justifiable can be chosen;
In addition, the algorithm should be prevented from becoming self-validating. Therefore, in addition to the purposive sample, a random sample also takes place. The subsequent decisions are used to generate new decision trees;
It is not clear to the staff assessing the supporting documents whether the relevant application fell into the random or targeted selection. This is to prevent them from being unknowingly influenced by this information;
Regarding explainability, the following is noted: the decision trees clearly show the different threshold values. These threshold values are clear, concrete and also explainable in application to a concrete case;
Finally, it is noted that a DPIA has been prepared; it has been submitted to the FG for advice and subsequently approved.

The calculation model checks your personal data. There are then two possibilities:

Risk-based prioritisation of data breach notifications,Dutch Data Protection Authority,"The AP uses this algorithm to classify data breach reports by severity. Based on that classification, inspectors can prioritise serious reports. The algorithm does not contain any personal data. ",No,Law,https://www.autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/datalek-melden,In use,"The AP's supervision of the data breach notification requirement is risk-based. Some data breach reports are so serious that AP inspectors have to pick them up urgently. To determine the severity of a data breach, the AP looks at the risk of harm faced by the victims of the data breach. The higher the risk, the sooner and the more intensively inspectors deal with the data breach notification. The AP has established a number of criteria to ensure that inspectors handle data breaches with serious consequences with urgency.","Data breaches can have serious consequences for victims. Therefore, an organisation that has a data breach must act quickly: quickly plug the data breach and also quickly warn victims of the consequences of the data breach. In addition, the organisation must report the data breach to the AP within 72 hours. This reporting obligation allows the AP to check whether the organisation handles the data breach carefully. The AP receives around 20,000 data breach reports per year. In order to be able to pick up the reports of the most serious data breaches urgently and to make optimal use of the AP's available capacity, prioritisation of data breach reports is necessary. An algorithm is used to determine this prioritisation. This is a simple algorithm in which various characteristics of a data breach notification are weighted. The operation of the algorithm is easy for inspectors to understand: it is easy to see why a particular report has or has not been given a high priority. In doing so, the AP does not use personal data, nor does it result in an immediate automatic decision.  ","

The algorithm does not process personal data entered by organisations, such as contact details.","
For prioritisation, the AP uses a decision tree. Based on knowledge and experience of inspectors, certain fields of the report form have been designated as input for the algorithm. If the entered value exceeds a set limit, an inspector picks up the report in question as a matter of urgency. This inspector then determines the steps to be taken.

","
After prioritising the data breach reports, inspectors handle the reports. Thus, these data breach reports always involve human intervention.







","When AP inspectors handle data breach reports, they also pay attention to the quality of the reports (e.g. whether they are complete and whether they contain enough relevant information). They also monitor the outcomes of the algorithm. Based on this, the AP can adjust risk indicators used in the algorithm if necessary. Furthermore, every year the AP publishes the data breach report, in which the AP provides insight into all data breach notifications received and their handling. Finally, the AP also uses the knowledge and experience gained from the AP's other supervisory tasks to identify any risks of or deviations in the prioritisation of reports.

The data will not be used for anything else and deleted after the objection period expires. The algorithm used detects non-relevant license plates and persons in the photos and makes them unrecognisable. ","The following is a functional explanation of how the algorithm works and the process in which it is used:
 


The scan car drives down the street on public roads in areas where parking is allowed only if paid for or one has a parking permit
Different types of cameras on the scan car (infrared, colour and panoramic cameras) automatically scan the license plates of all cars located in the area to be enforced
A GEO position is linked to each license plate
The scanned data is securely transmitted to Brickyard's back office
The algorithm checks, based on a geographic map provided by the municipality containing all relevant parking information, whether the geo-position of the license plate is in a given parking area
The data is filtered by the system and then the parking rights database (National Parking Register) is queried
If the license plate is not in there, a parking controller goes to the parked car and assesses the situation on the spot. If there are no details, the enforcer confirms that a fine (this is officially called post-parking tax assessment) will be sent to the owner of the car.

","An enforcer checks on the spot if there really is no payment and assesses the situation. If there is no special situation, a parking fine follows.","The main risk is that the system misrecognises a license plate number and someone who does not deserve it is fined. This can happen if a character on the license plate is wrongly recognised.

The municipality has the task of guiding residents with a distance to the labour market to suitable work. Passport for Work is a tool that can help make a good link between available jobs and jobseekers.,,0.4.0,,,team@passportforwork.nl,,,"
The following data are used by the algorithm:

Skills of job seekers:  The structure of this consists of data on behaviour, personality (measured by a science-based personality questionnaire), skills, motivation (measured by the RIASEC model), self-assessment and experience based on CV.
Skills that come with a job: A nationwide survey of employers, employees and sector representatives provided the information on which skills are important for a particular occupation, and at what level the skills are important. This was initially done for 24 occupations, in the construction, healthcare and engineering sectors.

","
Below is the functional explanation of how the algorithm works.
 


Algorithm to determine a job seeker's skill profile: Passport for Work maps job seekers' skills through a combination of self-assessment, neurogames and online role plays. Based on these tests, the algorithm determines the skill profile. This is a schematic overview of a jobseeker's skills.




Skill profile of professions and jobs: Each profession within Passport for Work has its own skill profile. This skill profile consists of an overview of competences a candidate must have for that profession. An employer can enter a vacancy for a particular profession. The employer can adopt the skill profile for that profession one-to-one or modify the profile.




Matching algorithm: The matching algorithm first looks at hard requirements such as possession of a driving licence, commuting distance or available working days. These are the so-called 'knock-out criteria'. But most importantly, it assesses whether a jobseeker has or can develop the skills that go with the job. The algorithm looks at how far a jobseeker's profile matches the job profile. It does this based on a weighting matrix. This translates the results of the tests into a score on each of the competences from the O*NET system. The highest score means that the competency matches exactly what is needed. The score for all competences together determines a person's possible suitability for a profession and job. The degree of possible suitability is indicated from most suitable to least suitable always showing all results.


","

A case manager, career counselor or supervisor discusses the skill profile with the jobseeker. They discuss whether they think the skill profile is correct and whether the job suggestions made by Password for Work fit.
A jobseeker decides whether the skill profile will be visible to employers.
A job seeker always gets to see all jobs and an employer all candidates. The algorithm only determines the order of jobs and job seekers. 

","

Circumstances while completing the tests can have a negative impact on the outcome. For example, if the job seeker is disturbed, unable to concentrate properly, the computer or the internet is not working properly, the conclusion may be wrongly drawn that the job seeker is not fast enough and therefore receives a lower rating.


Subjectivity or cultural influence: The matching system is based on current knowledge within psychometrics. However, cultural influences or subjectivity cannot be ruled out. The likelihood of such effects is difficult to estimate, but if they occur, they can have negative consequences for those involved.


Incorrect matching: There is a chance that, due to bugs or unforeseen issues, the measured competences or the calculation of the match is not correct. Then the outcome may be a less appropriate advice.


Limited matching: Passport for work cannot advise towards occupations and/or sectors not included in Passport for Work. As a result, jobseekers may miss out on an opportunity for (better) suitable work.

Game-based assessment (GBA) in selection of government-wide traineeships,Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations,A GBA is one part of the selection process.

https://www.werkenvoornederland.nl/starters/traineeships/internationaal-beleidsmedewerker---buitenlandse-zaken",In use,"The main purpose of deploying the GBA is to use the test results in conjunction with the results of other selection items to make an objective selection decision and ensure more equality in the mode of selection: no game experience is required for the GBA. Sub-goals of the deployment of this algorithm are:


A match based on qualities and talents rather than education level.
A structured approach that is the same for all candidates.
Making the test more accessible to candidates and appropriate for the target group.
Provide a way (in combination with other selection components) to select from many applications, which is not possible manually.

","
These are the following public values that inform the use of the algorithm:
Public values to which the algorithm contributes:

Equality (equal opportunities): This is where implementation research was done prior to the deployment of the GBA. The GBA targets a wide range of competences and talents which promotes diversity in the selection decision. 
Efficiency: There are very high numbers of applications for the State Trainee Programme. The government does not have the resources and capacity to handle this manually and is therefore forced to opt for a different selection mechanism that allows more efficient use of limited government resources.
Effectiveness: An effective government needs staff that is a good match for the tasks at hand. The GBA takes a broader look at competences and talents than previous tools (which mainly focused on intelligence). This allows a more sophisticated search for suitable candidates.


The public values that may be compromised by the use of the algorithm, or at least should be seen as a concern, are:

Equality: It is essential that the algorithm does not contain a bias that puts certain groups at a disadvantage.
Explainability: It is important that the GBA is and remains explainable and that there is a clear procedure for candidates to request more information on how a result was established. This procedure should also be actively communicated.
Accessibility: Accessibility as a public value may be at stake: not everyone can make the GBA. Sufficient customisation should be possible. Candidates are given the opportunity to share circumstances that may affect the selection procedure with Leeuwendaal and/or the State. All comments are gone through and assessed on an individual basis. Sometimes exemptions are granted on that basis.

The values outlined here should be seen as points of consideration, including for possible design changes and future developments. It is important to note that the negative impact on values formulated here will be mitigated by taking measures.

","
The Civil Service Act 2017 includes that ""Public employers may conduct an investigation into the suitability and competence of an employee for a civil service position"".  The following applies to the GBA:
The legal basis lies in the fact that a company has the right to hire a new employee: a government employer has the right to conduct an investigation into the suitability and competence of an employee. However, there is nothing to say about the procedure. However, there is an application code for this. This application code tells us more about the use of digital assessments: 
""If the organisation uses data recruitment in pre-selection, such as digital assessment, Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) or algorithms, for example, these should be validated and transparent. With the organisation using A.I and algorithms, the potential risks and shortcomings thereof should be clear. At all times, care and confidentiality should be ensured and no health-related questions should be asked. The applicant will receive a reasoned result after participation, if requested by the applicant"".
The use of the DPIA and the IAMA ensures that the assessment is validated and transparent.
",,0.4.0,,,rijkstrainee@rijksoverheid.nl,NLD,,"
Only data that can be extracted from the GBA completed by the candidate is used. The algorithm only uses data necessary to determine the final score (data minimisation). For example, no demographic information is made available to the models.
The exception here is when a candidate indicates having a neurodiverse condition. In that case, adjustments are made to allow the candidate to still take the test if the candidate is able to do so. Employer can also choose to exempt candidates from the GBA.
","This is a rule-based algorithm. Thus, there is no self-learning algorithm. It uses only the data obtained during the test. The answers entered by the candidates and chosen method during the test determine the scores on the competences. These competences are aligned with the State and determine the fit with the trainee profile. The test is started from the candidate's file through a technical link. No personal data are shared in this link. When the candidate is ready, the scores are calculated and retrieved from the GBA and the competency scores are displayed in the candidate's file.","
Based on the scores coming from the GBA, a report is fed back to the applicant. These scores are part of the file, which along with other data such as CV and motivation questions are used in the selection process. No selection decisions are made without the intervention of a State employee.
So there is definitely ""human in the loop"" because the recommendation is made by a person and the score is only part of this decision.
","
The effectiveness of the GBA is reviewed annually to ensure that the algorithm is and remains effective. 
To prevent the GBA algorithm from being used for other purposes for which it is not intended, it has been agreed that a separate IAMA will be carried out for each use. 
Because the deployment of an algorithm can raise questions, the provision of information to those involved is reviewed annually, partly on the basis of the questions asked during the application periods of State trainees.

When there are signals that the data in a key register may be incorrect or outdated, a feedback is sent to the source holder of that key data.
The source holder is responsible for managing and updating the data in the base register.

Objective:
Fees are fees for municipal services. Fees are set by the municipal council and are contained in the Fees Ordinance. To levy fees, we determine base types and fee types. Fees are calculated on a basis. The base type determines where the base for the fee calculation can be found.

Objective:
The purpose of the digital survey is to conduct the survey on B watercourses (inspection ditches) more efficiently (in time and cost).
 
Impact:
The consequences of digital scour are minimal for a parcel owner (company or citizen). 


The digital survey reduces the supervision burden for all plot owners. 
Using the Schouw M.app (dashboard and field application), the water board can provide better service to parcel owners, in case of a 'dirty' ditch.
Instead of water board employees physically checking all inspection ditches, where other things can also be seen and this can be more of an invasion of privacy, now only the 'dirty' ditches are checked. 
So through this method, attention is drawn to the situations that are not good. This rewards the plot owners with a lower supervision burden if they have fulfilled their obligation. 


","
Advantages:


Less supervision burden
Less staff deployment
Implementation of inspections within 1 team
Uniform working method
More service to landowners

Disadvantages:


Digital survey has technical limitations
Not all ditches can be assessed digitally (e.g. ditch located under trees) 
Satellite photo; no influence on recording moment (when taken and result is weather-dependent)


",The inspection of watercourses is laid down in the Water Act and the Water Board's Keur (regulation),,0.4.0,,,info@wdodelta.nl,nld,,"aerial photographs and satellite images, cadastral data, map of watercourses","
Step 1:
The algorithm (machine learning) looks for a relationship according to a specific statistical method between the bands in a multi-spectral satellite image (or aerial photo) and locations in watercourses rated as clean or not clean by a water board employee.
Step 2:
The relationship is stored in a so-called machine intellect that is used in the classification of watercourses for the entire area to be surveyed, presenting the result as clean or not clean locations in the watercourses. In case of insufficiently clean locations in a watercourse, the watercourse is classified as not clean.

Prior to the digital survey, training data (photos of ditches that are clean) is provided by the water board. This is for the purpose of training the algorithm/machine learning.
Human, visual inspection or based on the result of the digital inspection, via a computer dashboard. (screen inspection)
After the digital and screen inspections, a physical check of 'dirty' ditches takes place by water board employees.

","
A risk is false positive results; that is, where the ditch is not clean but is assessed as clean.
 
The ditch may not have been maintained when it should have been. And the responsible landowner is then not informed (warned) by letter. 
 
If the result of the digital survey of a screening ditch is questionable, it is classified as 'not clean'. These ditches are checked again by an employee during the screen inspection. This reduces the chance that a ditch that is not clean will still be classified as clean.

As a province, it is important for us to have up-to-date information on what is going on within its 50 municipalities. We were looking for a solution that would allow us to extract patterns from large-scale data and identify the opinions of relevant stakeholders. This enables constructive responses and better action by the province.
As a province, we already use 2 media monitoring systems, namely Lexis Nexis (newspapers) and Coosto (social media). Besides newspapers and twitter, Oog op Zuid-Holland also contains news from political parties and council documents from public meetings. Oog op Zuid-Holland has a more complete picture of the news spectrum compared to existing systems. It also selects relevant information better than current systems. Another added value offered by Oog op Zuid-Holland is ease of use. This stems from the fact that it was customised.
Oog op Zuid-Holland saved the testers time. Those who peruse the news through Oog op Zuid-Holland go much faster. Eye on South Holland goes through large amounts of data sources. As a result, it summarises a large amount of data and the testers go through news that they would normally never look up (twitter, news reports political parties).

This can sometimes lead to traffic unsafe situations. By collecting data on the numbers of pedestrians, it is possible to take measures to manage the crowds. This keeps the city comfortable, accessible and traffic safe. If a situation becomes unsafe due to excessive crowding, the municipality can intervene. This is done, for example, by placing digital information boards so that people know which routes to take. Or one-way traffic is established. With the crowd-monitoring system 'Public Eye', we map crowds in a few places in Amsterdam. Currently, the system is active on Arena Boulevard, the Marineterrein and Dam Square. These places have cameras linked to a municipality server. On the server, an algorithm analyses how many people are on the images. The information about the number of people present is forwarded to municipality employees, who can use the count to better regulate traffic. The images are not shown, only the numbers. Residents and visitors to the city can also view the information on the number of people present, via https://druktebeeld.amsterdam.nl/. Currently, this is only possible for the Marineterrein location. The ambition is to realise this for all Public Eye locations. As soon as the algorithm has counted the number of people present, the video images are immediately deleted. At each new location where Public Eye is placed, a small amount of footage is recorded, of which about 300 images are randomly annotated for the algorithm's training.

The cameras used for these images were hanging at the Marineterrein at a height of 3 to 15 metres during data collection. In this dataset, we manually annotated where people's heads are present in the image. These annotations were prepared in two stages, i.e. each annotation was checked once and adjusted if necessary.

In addition, the number is shown on https://druktebeeld.amsterdam.nl/. Currently, only the traffic at the Marineterrein location is shown, in the future also for the other Public Eye locations. The video images do not leave the server and are not stored. Only for training purposes a very limited number of images are kept, these are encrypted.

The locations and functions of the cameras are included in the Amsterdam municipality's camera register. Performance The algorithm needs to be about 70 per cent accurate to extract relevant insights to regulate traffic. In practice, the algorithm delivers about 90 per cent accuracy. We derive this from the training images. Besides operational performance, this project is constantly innovating. We are continuously looking for new functionalities that can improve the system: One of the ambitions is to build the system even more privacy-friendly, and we do this by adding a model that makes it possible to train the algorithm with fewer images per camera. This is called the ViCCT model, and we want the analysis to be performed on the sensor (the ""on edge"" technique).","Using the training data, the quality and accuracy of the algorithm is periodically evaluated by a small number of municipal employees who have permission to view the images.

The images are on the municipal infrastructure that complies with the Baseline Information Security Government (https://www.informatiebeveiligingsdienst.nl/project/baseline-informatiebeveiliging-overheid). If the images were to fall into the wrong hands unanonymised, the risk of a breach of privacy is relatively low: the camera is at such a high altitude that it is difficult to recognise people on the images. In addition, data minimisation is practised: the cameras in the ArenA area are only switched on from two hours prior to an event until the event is over. At other times, Public Eye's cameras in the ArenA area are off. Efforts are being made to also turn off Public Eye's cameras at the other locations at times when these cameras are not necessary, for example at night.

Blurring as a Service,Municipality of Amsterdam,Blurring as a Service (BaaS) is a generic service that allows anonymising images from public space by removing people and license plates.,,Organisation and business operations,https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/ai-system/blurring-as-a-service/1132/,In development,"
Blurring as a Service (BaaS) is a generic service that allows anonymising images from public space by removing people and license plates. The service can be used for different data sources and is first deployed for panoramic images.

Since 2016, panorama images of the entire city have been acquired annually by the Basic Information Department (Mobile Mapping team) to visualise the City of Amsterdam. Among other things, the panorama images allow municipal employees to inspect public space from their workplaces for various purposes, such as accessibility with special vehicles or inspection of roads. It is similar to how Google Streetview works, although this should provide a more up-to-date view of the city.
 
For these tasks, it is not necessary to visualise or keep recognisable persons or license plates. It was therefore decided that these images should be anonymised. The anonymisation algorithm has been developed for this purpose. The deployment of the algorithm can be considered a measure to process the data carefully and lawfully. The developed facility 'Blurring as a Service' can prevent images with recognisable people and license plates from being used for municipal work processes.

The Computer Vision Team developed the facility that allows panoramic images to be anonymised. The algorithm is trained to recognise entire persons, not just faces, and license plates on (panorama) images. This ensures that these persons and license plates are then 'blurred', effectively anonymising them.
","
It is conceivable that certain groups could be better or less well recognised by the algorithm. This could then result in different treatment or a distinction based on external characteristics, for example on the basis of gender, age, skin colour and related clothing and attributes (e.g. Disability, profession or hobby). The adverse consequence is that certain groups are more likely to be (temporarily) recognisable in Amsterdam municipality systems. This should obviously be avoided. 

The algorithm was trained on a balanced dataset, i.e., ensuring that as many groups as possible are represented. For example, images were selected around schools and also in neighbourhoods where more people with a non-Western migration background live in order to adequately represent children and people with different skin colours in the dataset.

There is an obligation on the municipality to investigate whether such a disparity exists. This investigation has now been carried out and the results can be accessed via: Link to public page.
",,,1.0.0,,,algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Architecture of the model:
The model is YOLOv5, a convolutional neural network that can be used for object detection. The network receives an image and predicts the locations of people and number plates on the images with so-called bounding boxes, aka squares. Subsequently, these areas are blurred by blurring the pixels.

Performance:
The anonymisation algorithm currently has an accuracy of roughly 95% for people close to the camera.
For number plates that are close to the camera, it anonymises about 97%.
The algorithm is tuned to prefer to anonymise slightly too much rather than too little. So it might find that a scooter, tree or other object is also blurred. We would rather blur a little too much than too little.
Through visual inspection on a sample, it was found that the persons who are not recognised are usually not recognisable because they are, for example, partially behind a tree. Ideally, of course, these persons would also be anonymised, unfortunately this is not yet possible.","
Processing basis:
The reason and necessity to develop an anonymisation algorithm is based on the municipality's task to keep the core register up to date and reliable. This is based on Article 2(2) of the Large-Scale Topography Key Register Act, and Article 2(1) of the Addresses and Buildings Key Register Act and Article 6(1)(e) of the AVG. In addition, the following is included in the relevant Regulation (Basic Information Regulations 2018:
A. The public task as source supplier for the core register of panoramic images (article 7); 
B. The public task as source holder. 
The process of anonymisation is a further processing of the acquired panorama images. That process can be considered compatible with the original purposes according to the WP29, provided the anonymisation process aims to reliably produce anonymised information and provided there is a basis for the primary use. See Article 29 Working Party, 'Opinion 5/2014 on anonymisation techniques', WP 216, p. 8: Given the performance of the algorithm, it can be said to be a reliable way of anonymising information. This performance has now been independently tested by an external party, Verdonck, Klooster &amp; Associates. The performance values have also been determined by the CIO. It can be concluded that this constitutes permissible compatible further processing. 
Basis (primary processing purpose) for the acquisition of the panoramic images:

Article 6(1)(e) AVG
Article 2 paragraph 2 Large-Scale Topography (Basic Registration) Act
Article 2 paragraph 1 Addresses and Buildings (Basic Registration) Act.
Regulation (Basic Information Regulations 2018 included the following: 

A. The public task as source supplier for the core register of panoramic images (Article 7); 
B. The public task as source owner. 
 
Basis (secondary processing purpose) for developing:

Article 6 paragraph 1 sub c and e AVG
Article 2 paragraph 2 Large-Scale Topography (Basic Registration) Act
Article 2 paragraph 1 Addresses and Buildings (Basic Registration) Act.
Regulation (Basic Information Regulations 2018) included the following:

C. The public task as source supplier for the core register of panoramic images (Article 7); 
D.The public task as source owner.

Art. 24 jo. 25 para. 1 and 2 jo. 32 AVG.

 
Personal data:

Face and posture of people in public spaces;
Face and posture of people who are in a residential object or office, or who are behind windows. Panoramic images are only taken outdoors. 
License plates;
Company details, e.g. on company vehicles, signs or premises.

Training:
The images collected over the past few years have been used as training data to develop the algorithm. These are roughly 10,000 raw images. These images were needed to manually train the algorithm to learn to recognise people and license plates.  The aim is for the algorithm to learn to be able to remove the persons and license plates on new images. This process is called 'annotation' and 'training'.  
This training set for the algorithm is stored in the City of Amsterdam's Azure cloud environment. The training set is kept as long as the algorithm is in use to possibly make future improvements. The panorama images are stored in an encrypted environment and only officials who need the images can access them, e.g. the algorithm's developers.
Testing:
Some of the data is captured, kept separate to then test the algorithm with. So the training and testing data virtually overlap, although they are different images. Roughly 1,000 number of images were used for testing. 
Operating:
The algorithm is currently being used for the following application:

Acquiring panoramic images twice a year for the purpose of keeping core records current and reliable. This involves a large quantity of images;
In the short term, the algorithm is expected to be used for anonymising images on which potentially illegally placed (heavy) containers have been spotted on vulnerable quay walls and bridges. This involves about 2,000 images per year. 

The number of applications may increase in the future. 
","
There is no automated decision-making by using the algorithm. A citizen or entrepreneur will never receive a decision or order generated by this algorithm. 
Users of the algorithm, after sending images to the Computer Vision Team, will receive back anonymised images. These images will be able to become part of a case, for example in the context of Supervision and Enforcement. The case handler can always judge for himself whether an image is sufficiently anonymised. 
A number of processes are in place to counteract errors.1. When processing a batch of images, a sample is taken and checked manually. This aims to verify that the algorithm does what is expected;
2. A feedback process is put in place so that errors can be corrected. In addition, these errors can also be used to improve the algorithm;
3. An annual evaluation takes place to determine whether the algorithm needs to be improved.

Through the learning effect, this percentage is being increased.

Photogrammetry deals with the interpretation and measurement of imagery in determining and describing the shape and size and location of objects. Here, the shape, location and dimensions are determined using mathematical models within an automated algorithm. The mathematical models used are not publicly available. This is confidential business information. No (inter)national standards for terrestrial positioning, photogrammetric and point cloud measurements are available. It is the employee who confirms the location and calculates the area of the advertisement. The rules governing this are set out in the tax ordinance. The employee's application of these rules thus determines the accuracy and precision of the measurement. The algorithm is self-learning. It uses the results of the employee's inspection to learn so that the image recognition becomes more accurate.",The system only makes a proposal for the advertisement to the clerk. The clerk always decides. The taxpayer has the opportunity to check the advertisements placed on assessment and submit amendments to them. The possibility of objecting and appealing against the assessment exists. This can be done at the digital desk of Taxation.,"The system is not risky in terms of privacy. It does not record personal data and only takes pictures of displays in public spaces. The biggest risk here is that the location of the advertisement becomes known, which could possibly make it possible to trace the address of a person or company. This is also possible on the street. Unauthorised persons cannot access the stored images due to the realised information security. Security risks are controlled by the overall security set-up on systems and connections. These meet the requirements. In execution, the biggest risk is that an advertisement is not scanned or measured correctly, resulting in someone getting the wrong assessment. However, the clerk always checks and determines the tax liability. The taxpayer can respond to the recorded advertisement and can object and appeal the tax assessment.

Residents and visitors to Amsterdam are entitled to clean air and a liveable climate. The air that visitors and residents currently breathe is not clean enough and this is largely due to city traffic. The environmental zones for cars, trucks, delivery vans, taxis, buses and mopeds and motorcycles in the municipality of Amsterdam were established to keep out the most polluting vehicles. By doing so, the municipality of Amsterdam aims to improve air quality in the city.
Other entry or transit bans have been introduced by the municipality to improve road safety and quality of life, for instance by preventing cut-through traffic or congestion.There is also automated enforcement of the 7.5-tonne zone to protect bridges and quay walls in the historic centre.The aim is to enforce environmental zones for passenger cars, trucks, vans, taxis, buses and mopeds and motorcycles in the municipality of Amsterdam established by traffic orders, so that the most polluting vehicles are kept out.The purpose enforcing the heavy traffic zone is to protect bridges and quay walls in the old centre.For the other zones, the aim is to enforce the underlying traffic orders of the municipality of Amsterdam.Within Amsterdam municipality's environmental zones, ANPR (automatic number plate recognition) cameras with algorithms are used to read license plates of passing vehicles. The license plate is then linked to information, such as vehicle information from the RDW (Dutch Vehicle Registration Authority), to a date, time and location. The enforcement of the is supported by several other rule-based algorithms. All these algorithms contribute to a decision with legal effect in case of violation of environmental and other zones (penalty decision).","The impact for the use of the algorithm is proportionate to the goal, which is the right of Amsterdam residents to clean air, a liveable climate, traffic safety, an accessible city and a pleasant living environment. Environmental zones keep the most polluting vehicles out of the city, thereby improving the city's air quality.

When a vehicle passes by, an ANPR camera takes a picture and in that picture a licence plate number is searched based on shape (plate finder). Image recognition techniques are then used to search for characters. For this, the algorithm uses dots and lines. In this way, an image of numbers and letters is created. This algorithm uses a reference database filled mainly with Dutch license plates, which is the best way to recognise them. The majority of vehicles (around 97%) are vehicles with Dutch license plates.2. An algorithm that assesses the reliability of license plate recognition.

Vehicle recognition algorithm This is an algorithm that is deployed only if it has been determined by Algorithm 1 that there is a non-Dutch license plate. Algorithm 3 uses image analysis to determine whether the passing vehicle is a passenger vehicle, van, truck or bus. The numbers of vehicles by category, location and time of passing, without registration number, are used for policy purposes, such as analyses for traffic research.4. Decision algorithm access to a zone To determine whether a passing vehicle has access to the zone as defined in the traffic decision, the relevant vehicle data belonging to the detected license plate are automatically requested from the RDW. If, based on this, it is found that the right of access is present, the registration number is irrevocably removed from the passage control system. If the right is not present, the system automatically checks whether an exemption is known to be linked to the licence plate. If so, the badge is irrevocably removed from the passage control system. All these steps follow the traffic decision one-to-one. If no right and no exemption are found, a penalty file is automatically compiled and forwarded to the CJIB, which sends the decision.&lt;See for a full description algorithm-register.amsterdam.nl given the limitation on the number of characters&gt;",,"Sampling by special investigating officers (boas) is an integral part of this automated decision-making process. A spot check is the manual assessment of whether the registration number of the vehicle in the violation photo matches the registration number as identified by the recognition software.

If an objection has been lodged, a violation photo is always assessed again (manually) by a BOA. In addition, those involved can view the violation photo themselves via https//Mijn.Amsterdam.nl and DigiD.","There are two types of risk namely: 1. The risk is that breaches are wrongly identified. 2. Another risk is that violations are missed. These risks are further mitigated as follows: License plate recognition algorithm: Minimal risk. If a registration number is misread and the misread registration number turns out to exist and belongs to a vehicle that does not have access to the environmental zone, the wrong person will be fined. This happens very rarely because the recognition software meets the tough requirements mentioned above and a check is made (randomly) by a BOA, and the chances of the incorrectly identified vehicle not having access to the environmental zone are small. In the single case that this does happen, an objection by the owner of the wrongly fined vehicle against the fine will of course be upheld. If the registration number of a vehicle that does not have access to the environmental zone is misread by the camera, the owner is wrongly not fined. This rarely happens. Other than by measures related to the reliability requirements for the recognition software in the cameras, this risk cannot be mitigated.

Researchworthiness: Smart check livelihood,Municipality of Amsterdam,Investigability Algorithm 'Smart check'. A tool that helps staff determine whether a life support application is research-worthy.,,Social Security,https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/ai-system/onderzoekswaardigheid-slimme-check-levensonderhoud/1086/,In development,"
The municipality of Amsterdam issues welfare benefits to Amsterdam residents who are entitled to them. Not everyone who applies for welfare benefits qualifies for them. That is why we investigate assistance applications that may be unlawful. The municipality of Amsterdam wants to prevent Amsterdammers from receiving unjustified assistance, accumulating debts and getting into trouble.

Even Amsterdam residents who are entitled to social assistance are sometimes investigated by an employee of Work and Income Enforcement. We want to prevent this as much as possible, because such investigations can be unpleasant. That is why we are testing whether an algorithm can help us determine which applications should and should not be investigated. So that Amsterdammers suffer less from our enforcement and so that fewer Amsterdammers get into trouble. But also to ensure that the provision of assistance remains affordable.

Currently, an employee determines whether an application is worthy of investigation and whether this should be assessed by an employee with additional powers. The 'Smart Check' algorithm supports the caseworker to determine whether a subsistence application is investigation-worthy. The algorithm makes transparent and explainable which data led to the label 'research-worthy'. All data used to arrive at an assessment are documented and described. 

PilotFrom April to July 2023, the municipality is conducting a pilot with a new working method. In this pilot, the 'smart check' algorithm determines whether an application is labelled 'research-worthy' or 'not research-worthy'. This is then checked by an employee of Enforcement Work and Income. The algorithm can find connections and patterns in a large amount of information on requested social assistance benefits and determines which information is more likely to be associated with applications that required further investigation and which are not. 'Smart Check' is trained on historical data and consists of 15 data points. At the end of the pilot, we will determine whether this way of working is better for Amsterdam citizens. 
","
This new approach to the pilot has a number of advantages:

Equivalence: We analysed the bias ('bias') of the algorithm. This showed that on almost all sensitive characteristics (such as age, country of birth and nationality), the developed model treats different groups more equally than it does now.
Effectiveness: The model can assess which applications are worthy of investigation better than a staff member. As a result, capacity can be better utilised, and fewer unlawful benefits are issued.
Proportionality: Because the model can better estimate which applications require additional checking, it is less common for applications to be examined unnecessarily. This leads to better proportionality. We also prevent the unlawful provision of benefits more often, leading to a more preventive rather than repressive approach.

Not everyone who submits an application is entitled to benefit. The employees of the Income Support Department process many applications based on the information in the application form and the documents provided. In those cases, it is clear that the applicant is entitled to benefits. Sometimes the information is not complete or unambiguous. Then it may be necessary to carry out additional research. This is done by staff from the Work and Income Enforcement Department.The 'Smart Check' algorithm supports staff in assessing life support applications by labelling them as worthy or not worthy of investigation. All maintenance applications are presented to 'Smart check'.Maintenance applicationWhen an Amsterdam resident submits a maintenance application, the application enters the Income Department's application to be processed.

There is no automated decision-making. The algorithm only advises whether an application needs additional investigation. After this advice, several employees carry out further extensive research.

First, an employee from the Work and Income Enforcement Department checks whether the application is really worth investigating.
If this is the case, another employee from the Work and Income Enforcement Department conducts an extensive investigation into its legitimacy. 
An opinion is issued on this and yet another employee (from Inkomensvoorziening) makes the final decision.

So there is no automated decision-making. There is meaningful human intervention before a decision is made. Work instructions are drawn up to avoid too much trust in the outcome of the model (automation bias). In addition, employees undergo training on how to use the information from the model in their work process.   
","
For this product, we relied on the General Court of Auditors' Framework. In addition, the main risk management analyses were done the DPIA (Data Protection Impact Assessment), KIIA (Artificial Intelligence Impact Assessment), IAMA (Human Rights and Algorithms Impact Assessment ) and the BIO Quickscan. These indicated the extent to which the risks can be eliminated or reduced, and what the residual risks are. We have taken several measures to ensure that the output of the model is correct, transparent and consistent. 
The model will also be closely monitored during the pilot (and in case of a successful pilot during management) to ensure the quality and fairness of the model also in the future.

We try to help people at risk of poverty as early as possible to prevent them from getting into serious debt or being evicted. When problems are still small, advice or a light intervention can be enough. To do that, we need to know who is at risk of getting into debt. That is why we receive notifications from health insurers, housing corporations, energy suppliers, water companies and some public authorities, among others, if they have a customer who is in arrears with their payments. This is also called the 'Amsterdam approach to early signalling'. That the creditor may pass this data to the municipality, including personal data, is stated in the Municipal Debt Assistance Act. After the report, the municipality supplements the data with information known to us about the reported person. This is information that is needed to determine whether or not someone is a benefit recipient, a client of WPI (the Werk, Participatie en Inkomen department of the municipality of Amsterdam) and to determine the best care provider to forward the notification to. Supplementing the notification with the information known to the municipality is done automatically, at the push of a button. Someone is always needed to trigger a check for data. The system forwards the notification to a counsellor at the municipality. He or she tries to get in touch with the citizen within 14 days and makes an initial analysis within 28 days. Sometimes there is more at play than arrears. If the citizen accepts help, we make detailed arrangements with him or her. The social worker reports to the central hotline what agreements have been made, so that a creditor knows what the next steps are for the payment arrears.",,,,1.0.0,,,algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Creditor notification Creditors make their notification of arrears in a specially developed registration and information system called 'RIS Matching'. The data in this dataset are all data needed to address the right citizen, find the right care provider and provide advice on which help the citizen would benefit most. Only health insurers have a legal basis (Government Gazette 2015) for supplying the BSN, the other creditors do not supply a BSN. The creditor can provide the following information at the time of notification: Customer number Early or crisis Debt amount Term amount Gender Initials Prefix Surname Street House number House number or suffix Postcode Location BSN (in case of health insurance) Date of birth Additional information (For example, with which 'label' someone is insured. The main label is Achmea, but someone may be insured with Zilveren Kruis, Avero, FBTO, for example. Also include contact details such as telephone number or e-mail address if known). Datawarehouse Poverty Reduction Department An employee of the municipality links the creditor's report to the data warehouse of the Poverty Reduction Department. Via the data warehouse, information can be retrieved from various databases so that we can determine which social worker can start working with the report. The list below shows exactly what information is involved. The following information, if known and if it concerns a client of WPI, is linked from the data warehouse to the notification. The information is needed not only to link the right social worker to the notification, but also for the social worker to start the conversation with the client together with the right client manager: House number House letter House number addition City District Area Neighbourhood A number Date of birth Age Benefit Administration number Coding Client manager Team client manager Additional information Children present Notification number Determining which department will work with the notification The notification from the creditor and the data about the citizen from WPI's data warehouse are then linked. A unique code applies to each department.&lt;See for a full description algorithm-register.amsterdam.nl given the limitation on the number of characters&gt;","Architecture of the model The creditor makes a notification in the registration and information system 'RIS Matching'. Once every fortnight, a municipality employee links all new notifications (at the push of a button) to data on the reported person from the Poverty Reduction Department's data warehouse and to data on the various debt assistance programmes available. This link allows the municipality to determine whether it is dealing with the right citizen and which social worker is best placed to contact the citizen. It then checks whether there are multiple debt arrears within one household. Up to this point, the process is automated. Next, there are a few possibilities: In the case of a single payment arrears of less than 250 euros, a text message, letter or e-mail is automatically sent from RIS Matching (depending on which contact details are available). This automated message refers to the website www.amsterdam.nl/geldproblemen . Here, citizens can find debt assistance in their district. If the debt exceeds EUR 250, the notification is automatically forwarded, based on information about the postcode area, to a social worker in the appropriate district or at a WPI department. The social worker tries to contact the citizen within 14 days. The social worker makes an initial analysis within 28 days. Often there is more at play than arrears. If the citizen accepts help, detailed arrangements are made with him or her. If it is not clear from the data whether the person with debts is known to the Poverty Reduction Department, the case is marked as 'unclear' in the system and forwarded to the Vroeg eropaf team. In the exceptional case that a report does not reach a social worker in the right district, the social worker reports this to the RIS Matching system manager. The latter then transfers the report to the correct care worker.","The system makes a number of choices independently (automated), for example to send a text message, email or letter in case of arrears lower than 250 euros, or to which postcode area the notification should be forwarded. During the data linking process, there is one moment of human supervision: the linking of the creditors' notification with the data of the Poverty Reduction Department is automated, but human action is required to start the linking. From the moment the notification is forwarded to the social workers in the appropriate district, the process is no longer automated. The social service provider visits the reported citizen if the citizen does not contact them himself.","The registration and information system called 'RIS Matching' is provided by the company Inforing, a company that supplies this system to 200 municipalities. They regularly carry out so-called 'pen and hack tests' to check that the system cannot be hacked by third parties. They also ensure that personal data is securely managed and not sold to third parties. Security also lies with Inforing. Security meets the BIO standard, and citizens can indicate at any time that they do not want to be listed in the system. The data are then immediately removed. In addition, citizens can access the system at any time. This concerns dataset 4, 'linked data' (see: Data). Other rules apply to the data in the data warehouse of the Poverty Reduction Department, namely the Urban Framework for Processing Personal Data and the General Data Protection Regulation. The data warehouse and debt arrears reports are two separate systems and debt arrears reports do not enter the data warehouse. At the time the municipality has to remove the data from the RIS Matching system, no information on debt arrears remains with the municipality.

Object Recognition Public Space Containers,Municipality of Amsterdam,Directorate V&amp;OR commissioned the Computer Vision Team of the City of Amsterdam to explore how object recognition can help prevent vulnerable bridges and quay walls from collapsing as heavy objects are placed on them. ,,"Economy, Space and Infrastructure",https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/ai-system/objectherkenning-openbare-ruimte-containers/1144/,In development,"Directorate V&amp;OR commissioned the Computer Vision Team of the City of Amsterdam (hereafter CVT) to explore how object recognition can help prevent vulnerable bridges and quay walls from collapsing due to heavy objects being placed on them. Containers are heavy objects that increase the risk of collapse. Currently, there is no clear view of where these containers are located in (vulnerable) parts of the city. During the Pilot, we will test whether containers can be successfully recognised in public spaces with a scanning vehicle equipped with a camera. After recognising containers in public space, a signal can be generated. By providing this signal with additional information from (municipal) sources, the work of supervisors can also be carried out better. This can be done, for instance, by including in a report information on how urgent the signal is based on the vulnerability of the particular quay on which the container has been placed. As a result, urgent situations can be prioritised. In addition to generating a signal, employees can use a digital map showing the containers found. Update 2024:The pilot has now been successfully completed. It has been shown that containers can be successfully recognised and that the technology can be used to identify misplaced containers more effectively.","The bridges and quay walls in the city centre have been severely weakened by years of excessive loads. At the time these bridges and quays were built, there was no heavy traffic. We are strengthening or replacing the bridges and quay walls.

Blur algorithmIt involves roughly 10,000 images of raw, i.e. not anonymised, data. These images were needed to teach the algorithm to manually recognise people and license plates so that they can be removed from images. This process is called 'annotation' and 'training'. These images are only accessible to some developers who train the models. The images are kept for as long as the algorithm may need further development.Image recognition algorithm. To teach this algorithm to recognise containers properly, roughly 1,500 partly anonymised and partly non-anonymised images were used to train the algorithm manually. Using non-anonymised images was necessary in order to keep the context (public space of the municipality of Amsterdam) intact as much as possible. This ensures that the algorithm is better able to recognise the containers. Unlike e.g. Google Maps, the municipality also blurs the entire posture of people in public space.Name: Production dataDataset descriptionImagesThe Scan system captures images containing the following metadata:Date;Time of day;Location (Coordinates according to 'WGS84' (EPSG 4326) and according to 'Amersfoort / RD New (EPSG 28992));Heading (expressed in degrees starting from north).These images are then all anonymised using the blur algorithm developed by the municipality of Amsterdam. Immediately after this, the images are filtered for images with containers on them with the image recognition algorithm 'containers'. All images in which no containers are visible are immediately removed. The images with containers on them are enriched with the following data. ... &lt;See full description algorithm-register.amsterdam.nl given the limitation on the number of characters&gt;","PerformanceThe algorithms perform well based on results with the training dataset. The intended Pilot is necessary to test the algorithms with production data. Performance is measured accurately during the Pilot. Nevertheless, each algorithm also has a so-called margin of error. The CFT has investigated this and these occur in the following situation:Image recognition algorithmThe container is too far away so the algorithm does not recognise the container. However, the risk of missing the container is small, now that it is likely that in the high-risk area, the scanning vehicle will eventually pass the container anyway, allowing it to be recognised.  Blural algorithmThe blur algorithm currently has an accuracy of roughly 95% for people standing close to the camera. For people standing further away from the camera, it is around 92%. Through visual inspection on a sample, it was found that the people who are not recognised are usually not recognisable because they are, for example, partially behind a tree. Ideally, of course, these persons would also be blurred. In the coming months, the blurring algorithm will be further developed. The performance is expected to improve further and approximate 99%. For the Pilot, and given all the measures taken to process the images safely, the 95% accuracy is considered sufficient for now. As additional measures, images based on which no signal is generated will be removed. This will be done within 24 hours.  Update 2024: Blurring as a Service (BaaS) has now been deployed, this will be used in a possible follow-up project to anonymise the images.","There is no automated decision-making by using the image recognition facility. The facility does generate a signal automatically. This signal is then assessed (manually) by a supervisor, after which an off-site investigation may take place. The supervisor makes an independent assessment of whether the situation is legal or illegal. If the latter, an enforcer will make an independent decision. With this, there is sufficiently meaningful human intervention. The 'output' of the algorithms does contribute to making the 'decision' whether or not to conduct further investigation (field investigation) into the observed container in the public space. Thus, the facility (with its associated algorithms) does have a substantial influence. ","The so-called 'data chain' was extended during the Pilot. This means that measures have been taken across the board to process the data safely and to resolve incidents (e.g. the blur algorithm no longer works) quickly and effectively according to established procedures. During the Pilot, particular attention will be paid to carefully anonymising the images and properly deleting the redundant data. In addition, much attention will be paid to the end users of the facility. They must be well informed about how the facility (with its algorithms) works and what the potential risks are. Supervisors should always be able to arrive at choices independently. As a result, it is important that the output can be interpreted properly and that they can also override a signal.

The hallmarks of these approaches are customisation within a person-centred approach. AcVZ is programme manager of a number of large integrated person-centred approaches, including the Top400 and Top600. The Top600 and Top400 are two programmes that aim to reduce the number of high-impact crimes, also known as High Impact Crime or HIC (robberies, street robberies, burglaries, serious violence, murder/death) and drug trafficking-related drug and violent crimes. This is done using an integrated person-centred approach (tailor-made approach) targeting people who are repeatedly suspected and convicted of such offences. The approach is aimed at stopping crime, improving the opportunities and quality of life of these individuals, preventing the negative impact of these individuals on their underage siblings, if any, and their underage children, and protecting the victims and the environment of these individuals from anything arising from criminal behaviour. The difference between the Top600 and the Top400 is that the Top400 focuses on the 12- to 23-year-old group, which is even less advanced criminally (e.g. fewer convictions) but with clear signs of concern(s). The Top600 focuses on individuals with a solid criminal (HIC) background, and who are not (or no longer) on the Top400 list. The Top600 and Top400 are two programmes of the Action Centre for Safety and Care (AcVZ), where a network of (government) parties jointly tackle social problems in the field of safety and care. Which problems these are is jointly determined by the organisations that make up the AcVZ, under the direction of the City of Amsterdam.",,,,1.0.0,,,algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Individuals can only enter the Top600 and Top400 when they meet the criteria of these approaches.

The criteria are available on the AcVZ website, as are the covenants, arrangements and who the partners are. Generally, there are 'intake moments' twice a year for both approaches. Individuals who meet the criteria flow in, those who no longer meet them flow out. Top 400 criteria To determine inflow for the Top 400, data from: Police criteria: If suspects are arrested for a High Impact Crime (arrested at least once within five years) or if suspects are arrested for a felony (arrested at least twice within two years) Care criteria: Contains at least three of the following criteria has a judicial measure on the reference date; has a civil measure on the reference date; official report for compulsory education or home-schooler or absolute absentee or dropout or more than 3x school changes in primary school age or more than 2x school changes in secondary (special) education; involved in domestic violence incident; arrested as a suspect between 12 and 14 years of age; arrested for APV (General Municipal Bye-Law) violation dealing in fake dope; is part of a prioritised youth group on the reference date.

All incoming data is then checked by analysts for accuracy, to make sure that the persons in one dataset are the same as in the other dataset(s). The datasets are then juxtaposed to reveal which individuals meet each part of the criteria. Once this has been done with all relevant parts of the criteria, those persons who currently meet the criteria remain. The selection of persons in the Top400 and Top600 therefore consists only of adding up a certain criterion (e.g. arrests, or compulsory education records) in a certain period (usually 2 or 5 years), and then juxtaposing those results to see which persons meet each part of the criteria.","The compilation of the lists is done by a team of analysts at the AcVZ. They carry out various checks to ensure the integrity of the data (is the data correct?).

After placement on the list, a specially trained director is given control of the person (and file), once again clearly stating why the person is on the list.

With the deployment of the algorithm, decision making is accelerated so that as many entrepreneurs as possible can receive grants on time. The algorithm speeds up the decision-making process for awarding a grant, and it provides risk guidance for the manual flow.
","
The use of the algorithm in TEK applications ensures that entrepreneurs' applications can be processed quickly and efficiently. Most of the entrepreneurs have the money in their accounts quickly. When an application fails to manual check, an employee has to assess the application. In that case, it takes longer for a decision on the allowance to be made, resulting in the money being in the entrepreneur's account later

The algorithm uses data on turnover, energy consumption, energy connections, Chamber of Commerce data and data from the entrepreneur's own application.
","

RFO deploys an algorithm to support the assessment of applications from entrepreneurs. This algorithm tests whether an application meets the conditions set by the minister. This is done using a risk model: when an application arrives at RFO, an estimate is made as to whether the entrepreneur is actually entitled to the allowance.
Here, for example, RFO compares the applicant's declared information with other data, such as VAT declarations at the Tax Administration and consumption values at the grid operators.
An application is automatically approved if the algorithm classifies the application as low risk, for example because the amount claimed by the applicant is low and there are no indications of abuse or improper use. In that case, no more employee is involved.

","  The risk model determines the qualitative and quantitative risk of each application; those factors together form the overall risk category. In case the algorithm identifies an application as high risk, it falls out to a manual check by a staff member. For example, because the amount is high, the application is incomplete, or there is evidence of abuse or improper use. The application is then prepared for human review. The algorithm gives advice to the employee on what to look out for, such as data that is incomplete or contradictory. This can be useful: the advice helps the clerk get a quick picture of the situation. The clerk then reviews the entire application. The clerk can then approve or reject applications, possibly after a further request for information. A negative decision (no grant or lower grant) therefore does not follow from the risk model but always from an employee's assessment. In case of deviation from the customer request and for subsidy amounts above a certain limit, this is always done through the four-eye principle.","
The risk model is submitted for approval to an interdepartmental advisory committee (rolling review), which advises the general director RFO on the application of the risk model. Only after they advise positively on the use of the algorithm (or a change to it) will the algorithm be put into use.

A detailed description will be added to the register when the algorithms are put into use.

Detection of illegal passenger shipping: In 2020, the municipality of Amsterdam started developing a report to detect illegal passenger shipping. In Amsterdam, passenger shipping is regulated by a permit. Vessels carrying passengers without a licence constitute unfair competition for licensed passenger vessels and are associated with nuisance on the water. The report provides a weekly overview of pleasure craft that regularly sailed the same route in the past week. This insight comes from the mandatory vignettes for pleasure craft. The passage of vessels with vignettes can be measured as vessels pass by at a short distance from a sensor. The algorithm consists of a calculation rule, which determines which vignettes sail the same round several days a week, more than once a day. The aim is to help fairway inspectors detect illegal pleasure craft by identifying hotspots and frequently used routes. Enforcement occurs only in the act and only by an authorised fairway inspector, there is no enforcement based on automatic decision-making or remote interventions.","

Reporting passenger shipping speeding: There is a speed limit on Amsterdam's inland waterways to prevent unsafe situations and nuisance. Exceeding the speed limit causes unsafe situations and nuisance, especially due to wave action. The algorithm uses AIS data from passenger vessels to measure speeding.

The model is under development and not in use. The algorithm is applied to create a heatmap.

A detailed description will be added to the register when the algorithms are put into use.
Detection of noise pollution on the water:In Amsterdam, there are many reports of noise pollution on the water. Waterway inspectors can impose fines when noise nuisance is detected in the act. To support enforcement, sensors have been installed that register noise volume and movement on the water. The algorithm identifies potential noise nuisance based on three criteria: noise volume from the water is above a threshold, higher noise volume than from the shore and simultaneous movement from a vessel. When these criteria apply, an incident of potential noise nuisance is recorded. The recorded incidents can be used to gain insight into hotspots of structural nuisance locations. Based on this information, fairway inspectors can visit and monitor a location.

Reporting berth usage by passenger vessels: Passenger vessels are only allowed to moor at licensed berths in public waters. The number of licensed moorings is limited. A report, based on AIS data, determines whether passenger vessels are within their licensed mooring area at night. The algorithm notifies if a passenger vessel is in public water at night without a permit for that location. These reports provide insight into compliance with mooring usage rules and can be used for information-driven deployment and checks by waterway inspectors.","

The output consists of a value for the reliability of the estimate and a top 10 components that make the highest contribution to it. The Monte Carlo Methodology is based on an algorithm. The description of the methodology reads: 

Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. The underlying concept is to use randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. They are often used in physical and mathematical problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other approaches. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three problem classes: optimisation, numerical integration, and generating draws from a probability distribution.

The internet site used works with automated Monte Carlo algorithms and generates information that is used in credit decisions.

Digital moat: crowds per rak,Municipality of Amsterdam,This algorithm calculates the number of vessels passing each rack per hour,,"Economy, Space and Infrastructure, Traffic",,In development,"

Dynamic boating traffic modelCrowds per rak: 
This algorithm calculates the number of vessels passing each rak per hour. A rak is a stretch of waterway between, for example, two bridges or a bridge and a lock. The purpose of this algorithm is to understand traffic flows and how they change over time. Gathering this information helps inform, and evaluate, policies and make decisions about traffic measures.
Traffic volumes are determined from two data sources: location data from vessels with an AIS transponder (mainly commercial shipping) and passages of vessels with an electronic vignette. Electronic vignettes are mandatory for motorised pleasure and commercial vessels. The passage of vessels with vignette can be measured as vessels pass a short distance from a sensor.  By measuring the shortest route of each vessel, the model derives itineraries of vessels. This pseudominated data is translated into the number of passages per hour per rack. Developed in 2020, the ""crowds per rak"" report provides up-to-date traffic volumes via the Digital Canal dashboard. The historically aggregated data are also used for analysis.

Boating traffic model: The ""Pressure per rak"" model adds up the current and historical hourly passages per rak. Thus, we calculate the traffic intensity per rak, but not the maximum capacity of a rak. The ""Busy per rak"" model also cannot predict changes in water use. A boating traffic model is developed to map changes such as the increase or decrease of recreational boating and the effect after interventions such as a blockage or a traffic measure.

The boating traffic model has been under development since 2022 and will show capacity per stretch. How many vessels can pass per hour? Indicators of congestion (such as decrease in speed) are used to calculate the maximum capacity per rack, per hour. Predictions are made based on average travel patterns per user group. The user groups are pleasure boaters, passenger boaters and transport boaters. The data may be supplemented by data on logistics flows, tourist locations and aggregated demographic data.

Location data /Combining datasets: At very low numbers along sensors and when combined with other datasets, it could theoretically be possible that a trajectory of a passer-by could be tracked along several sensors.

""Resono measures crowds at any location with a mobile panel of more than a million people. With this, we make an accurate estimate of crowds within a given time frame. Locations can vary in area and type. Think, for example, of a shop, shopping area, car park, neighbourhood or city. With Resono, customers have integral insight into visitor behaviour.""

The purpose of the models is to translate a value into a busyness indicator: not busy: easy to keep 1.5m distance / enough parking spaces (colour green) busy: possible to keep 1.5m distance / few available parking spaces (colour orange) too busy: difficult/not possible to keep 1.5m distance / (almost) no available parking spaces (colour red) Busyness is somewhat subjective. The aim is to show the average crowding of app users through the colours in Busy Imagew When the 1.5m measure was abolished, we changed the definitions of the colours. We use user feedback when setting pressure thresholds (not directly when users provide feedback). The models create two threshold values per location: low-pressure threshold and high-pressure threshold. These values are calculated and stored every few weeks (Resono) or months (CMSA &amp; parking). If the count at a location, at a given time is: Below pressure threshold low, a location gets the indication ""not busy"". Between pressure threshold low and pressure threshold high, it gets the indication ""busy"". Above crowd threshold high, it gets the indication ""too busy"". These pressure indications are calculated every 15 minutes per location (from each source) and displayed in the Busy Image web app. Passer-by model (CMSA): The purpose of this model is to create thresholds for the number of people passing a sensor. Pressure thresholds are calculated directly based on the width of the street where the sensor is located. We explain this in more detail on the Public Eye page of the algorithm register ( https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/public-eye/ ). For some locations, the municipality's crowd management team can adjust values based on visitor feedback. Impression model (Resono): The purpose of this model is to calculate thresholds to estimate how many people are in a given area. The model is a decision tree with the following inputs: historical Resono data; type of location (park/square/shopping street); area (square metres of the park/square/shopping street); length of paths within the area (collected with OpenStreetMap); feedback from web app users (input from https://druktebeeld.amsterdam.nl/feedback ); and feedback from the municipality's crowd management team. The resulting pressure thresholds obviously differ per location. Parking model: With pressure data from the past, we can give an indication of how likely a location is to become full at the time the user checks Pressure View. The pressure data also gives an indication of whether there is sufficient time between the moment a user consults Druktebeeld and the moment he arrives at the parking location and finds a space. The occupancy rate is determined on the basis of: the available spaces; the total capacity per garage as the difference between the total number of available spaces; and the available spaces of the past 5 quarters of an hour. At the moment, we only use information on short-term parking. Thresholds are determined for each location by analysing historical data. For most locations, the pressure threshold 'low' is set at 90 per cent occupancy. Below this percentage, there are sufficient spaces. For these locations, the pressure threshold 'high' is set at 95 per cent. Between 90 per cent and 95 per cent, there are sufficient places available, but they are likely to be full within 30 minutes. For some locations, spaces may fill up faster. At those locations, the thresholds 'low' and 'high' are 80 per cent and 90 per cent respectively. Busy metro stops: We make a busy forecast for the coming week at metro stops. For this, we use past check-in and check-out data, weather data and the weather forecast. The threshold values are set per stop, depending on their surface area. The bus density forecast is determined on the basis of: Number of check-ins and check-outs in the past year Surface area of the metro stop Weather data in the past week Weather forecast for the coming week","No automated decisions are made based on Druktebeeld's models. Every decision based on crowding is made by people, who can be either officials or citizens, with support from the Druktebeeld data and web app. From the 'pass-by' and 'impression' models come mass indications. These are monitored by issuing a report every few weeks. This report evaluates the input data, user feedback on the crowd indications and feedback from the crowd management team on the crowd indications. The report includes tables and graphs with data and results that appear unexpected/irregular. Following the results of the report, the models are adjusted as necessary.","The risks identified are: Decision is made on incorrect indication of crowd. Residents/visitors feel they are being watched by the municipality. Unintended use of the information. The municipality has not been able to independently establish that the data obtained by Resono is fully anonymised. ICT has commissioned an independent investigation and issued a certificate for this, see risk 'data obtained'.

Enforcing illegal holiday rentals,Municipality of Amsterdam,"There is limited housing and accommodation in Amsterdam, both for Amsterdam residents and visitors. Renting out a house or houseboat to tourists must meet certain conditions. ",,"Economy, Space and Infrastructure",https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/handhaving-illegale-vakantieverhuur/,Out of use,"For example, it is allowed for a maximum of 30 nights a year and to 4 people at a time. It must be reported to the municipality. Not everyone abides by these conditions. The municipality sometimes receives reports from neighbours who suspect that a property has been unjustly let. Staff from Supervision &amp; Enforcement investigate them. The algorithm helps prioritise the reports so that limited enforcement capacity can be used efficiently and effectively. By analysing data, the algorithm estimates the risk that the property at the reported address is being rented out illegally. To do so, the algorithm uses data from illegal holiday rentals from the past five years. This includes reports, data collected by the municipality during the work process, personal data (Basic Registration of Persons) and data on buildings (Basic Registration of Addresses and Buildings).",,,,1.0.0,,,algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Identity and housing data (BRP) A limited set of data from the Basic Registration of Persons (BRP) on the identity and housing situation of the occupants, namely: name of registered occupants; date of birth; Amsterdam departure date; address departure date; address settlement date; date of death.
Building data (BAG) A limited set of data from the Basic Registration of Addresses and Buildings (BAG) about the building, namely: address, street code, postal code; id address; description of building; Amsterdam BAG code, national BAG code; type of dwelling (rented, social rented / free sector, sale); addressable BAG ID number of rooms; floor area; floor level of front door flat; number of floors; description floor residential property.

The algorithm calculates which information is more likely to be associated with illegal holiday rentals and which information is not. The algorithm does this by performing mathematical calculations according to the probability tree principle. That is, the algorithm takes an average based on a large number of probabilities. This average is used to generate the mathematical expectation of illegal holiday rentals at an address. The algorithm calculates this expectation only when we receive a new report (e.g. from a local resident or rental platform) of possible illegal holiday rentals. This algorithm is called a 'random forest regression algorithm'. To make the trade-offs made by the algorithm understandable to people, we apply the ""SHAP"" methodology (SHapley Additive exPlanations; https://github.com/slundberg/shap). For each individual case, SHAP calculates which indicators contributed to that prediction and whether this caused the prediction to be higher or lower. This way, an employee can always see what the algorithm based the risk estimate on and make a considered decision.        Performance The advantage of a 'random forest regression' is that it is a reasonably complex algorithm that can closely approximate reality. But there is a chance of overfitting. A 'tree' with many layers squeezes the data to deliver specific answers. It has been studied how many layers the model needs to remain generically deployable and thus not overfitting. In addition, data points are continuously categorised (grouped) so that the model has a manageable number of possibilities instead of an infinite number with continuous values. This improves the model's ability to reach a conclusion.","There is no automated decision-making. When we investigate an address for suspected illegal holiday rentals, it comes from a report from, for example, a local resident or a rental platform. The algorithm helps Supervision &amp; Enforcement staff determine which reports are most likely to be illegal rentals, so those reports can be investigated first. The employee is shown an overview, which shows based on which criteria the algorithm estimates the risk of illegal holiday rentals to be high or low. In this way, we provide insight into what the algorithm has based its risk assessment on. Whether illegal holiday lets are actually present is determined by the supervisor responsible and the project enforcer. A preliminary and field investigation is carried out for this purpose. The file is then intensively discussed in a debriefing with the staff who can proceed to decision making. The algorithm has a substantial influence on the order in which we deal with reports, but does not independently make decisions on whether or not illegal holiday rentals are involved. To prevent employees from putting too much faith in the algorithm, someone has been appointed to monitor the algorithm and its operation. In addition, work instructions have been drafted for the employees who will work with this tool. In doing so, employees attend workshop on the opportunities and risks of using algorithms.","The system obviously affects the potential offender. Indeed, a report may be given more or less priority than without the algorithm. We have taken several measures to ensure that all risk estimates of the algorithm are not based on chance. One important measure is that we extensively and continuously evaluate this algorithm in a pilot phase for e.g. reliability, before implementing it in operations.",,NotificationMonitoring and enforcement,,,,,,,,Impactful algorithms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Parking control,Municipality of Amsterdam,"To keep Amsterdam liveable and accessible, only a limited number of cars are allowed to park in the city. ",,"Economy, Space and Infrastructure",https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/parkeercontrole/,In use,"To keep Amsterdam liveable and accessible, only a limited number of cars are allowed to park in the city. The municipality checks whether a parked car has the right to be parked, i.e. whether someone has paid a parking fee or has a parking permit. To work more efficiently, we do this check with scanning cars. With these, we currently check more than 150,000 official parking spaces in Amsterdam. The scan cars are equipped with cameras and drive past parking spaces in the city. The cameras capture car license plates and use an image recognition algorithm to identify license plates. The license plate number is sent to the National Parking Register where it checks whether the car has the right to be parked. If a person is found not to have paid a parking fee, a controller assesses whether there is a special situation (loading or unloading, stationary cars in front of a traffic light) based on ambient photos. If in doubt, a parking inspector reviews the situation on the spot. If there is no special situation, a parking ticket ('additional parking tax assessment') follows. Increasing the chance of being caught increases fairness towards those who do pay or have a valid parking permit. Enforcing the offence of 'standing still on the pavement' reduces nuisance and increases liveability for those who do pay or have a valid parking permit.",,,,1.0.0,,,Algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Scanned license plates Scan cars with automated license plate recognition drive around the city to recognise license plates of parked cars. The data processed by the scan cars are the scanned images of number plates, along with the location of the car and time stamp data. If parking fees have been paid, the data is anonymised after 48 hours (license plate images and surrounding photos are deleted; the license plate is removed from the metadata). If no parking fee has been paid, data are kept for as long as necessary for objection and appeal purposes. National Parking Register (NPR) The National Parking Register is a national database in which all current parking rights of license plates are registered. The register is managed by the RDW. The data is collected from parking meters and parking apps of municipal and commercial parking companies, parking providers and enforcers. Data on parking rights are kept in the register for 13 weeks after the parking right ends (accessible only to authorised personnel). Registry data is used to check whether someone is allowed to park somewhere.","Architecture of the model Algorithms are used: to locate the number plate in the camera images; to adjust the images for identification and; to identify the individual characters of the number plate. Once a number plate is identified and processed, the license plate data is sent to the National Parking Register for further processing. An NPR algorithm then checks the validity of parking rights for the license plate at a given time and location (for information on that algorithm, see the information on NPR's website: https://nationaalparkeerregister.nl/downloads/downloads-mobiel-parkeren.html - in particular the technical documentation). A positive result means that the car has valid parking rights. In that case, the scan data of the number plate is deleted within 48 hours. In case of a negative result, the images are checked by an employee of EGIS Parking Services B.V., which carries out parking checks on behalf of the municipality of Amsterdam. EGIS assesses whether there is a special situation, such as loading and unloading or a traffic light. If in doubt, a parking inspector looks at the situation on the spot. If a license plate has no valid parking rights, the data are transferred to the municipal tax authority. They use the RDW's database to link the license plate to the owner's personal data and send a parking ticket ('parking tax fine'). In addition to checking for paid parking and enforcing parking on the pavement, the scan car is used to detect stolen vehicles and vehicles with a police or public prosecutor's demand based on the scanned license plates. Because the scanning car runs the scanned license plates against the public data at the RDW (vehicles registered as stolen), the National Vehicle Crime Information Centre (possibly together with police) can trace that vehicle if there is a match. Data are also collected on parking pressure and the type of permit holder.","Human controllers review the images to see if there is a special situation, for example loading or unloading, or stationary cars at a traffic light. They also check whether licence plate number is read correctly. If in doubt, a parking controller reviews the situation on the spot.","The system has a low risk. The main risk is that the system mis-recognises a license plate and someone is fined that does not deserve it. This can happen if a letter or number on the license plate is misrecognised by both the algorithm and the controller. To manage this risk, people are given the opportunity to object in writing within six weeks via a website (naheffingsaanslag.amsterdam.nl). Those who object will be given the opportunity to see the licence plate photo and a situational photograph, if available.

Performing Wage Value Measurement,Municipality of Amsterdam,Application supports the process of determining wage value. The aim of the application is to determine wage value in a uniform manner; a national methodology for this has been available since 2021. ,,Social Security,https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/ai-system/uitvoeren-loonwaardemeting/1148/,In development,"Application supports the process of determining wage value. The aim of the application is to determine the wage value in a uniform manner; a national methodology for this has been available since 2021. Under the Participation Act, those entitled to benefits can apply for guidance and the instruments of the Directorate for Work and Participation. If a person has a suspected work limitation, a wage-value determination can be used to measure reduced labour productivity. The moment an employee's productivity is lower than an average employee, you as an employer can receive compensation for this in the form of a wage subsidy. The amount of the wage subsidy is determined by a wage-value expert in the form of a wage-value measurement.Due to a work limitation, the employee is unable to offer full productivity. At that point, the municipality subsidises part of the wage and guidance costs. The productivity not provided is measured and compensated with a wage subsidy to the employer that supplements the established wage value to the level of the legal minimum wage. The uniform wage value methodology calculates the (reduced) labour productivity of an employee on of the three variables: pace, quality and net working time.","The percentage of reduced wage value is calculated with the algorithm entirely according to the legal rules. A manual calculation will give the same outcome. The mere fact that this is now automated does not in itself have any consequences for the employee's employment contract and income.The wage value percentage can be seen as special personal data, because it says something about the employability of the person in question. When determining the wage value, it concerns only the degree of limitation, not the nature of the limitation.",,,1.0.0,,,Algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Name: Wage value measurementDataset descriptionThe wage-value measurement consists of a workplace observation and a conversation between the wage-value expert, the employee and the employer. Prior to the workplace visit, input is requested from the employer and the employee by means of two questionnaires (see appendix A Employer Questionnaire and B Employee Questionnaire). The questions and data relate to the employee's range of tasks and make a comparison with the norm function of regular employees. The norm function is a comparable function performed by a person without a work limitation. The norm function and/or the main tasks are always grafted onto a regular function 'common' within the industry or sector. The data used in the report is structured according to the steps of the uniform wage-value determination:purpose of the wage-value measurement;employee and employer data, such as name, address, place of residence/location, employer contact name;task and hour analysis: an analysis of the tasks the employee has and the number of hours he can work in the job concerned;norm function;determination of work performance and wage value;advice on reassessment of wage value.","Description of the system architectureData processing begins the moment a professional from the Amsterdam municipality places an application to perform a wage-value measurement. The application starts the process of performing the wage-value measurement and a wage-value expert is associated with it. The wage value expert makes an appointment with the employer for the wage value measurement. After confirming the appointment, both the employee and the employer receive information about the wage-value measurement and a questionnaire. The wage value measurement is carried out in accordance with the uniform wage value methodology based on an interview with the employee and the employer and an observation in practice. The wage value expert explicitly states during the introduction that the wage value measurement is carried out objectively based on actual observations and sources. The wage value expert tests the statements and assumptions of employee and employer by actual observations during the performance of work and by consulting sources. This prevents the process or advice from being influenced by the employee, employer or personal insights. After performing the wage-value measurement, the data are entered into the application by the wage-value expert. A wage value expert enters data on the three variables tempo, quality and net working time of the employee into the application (substantiation and calculation of variables compared to a regular employee) to calculate the percentage (reduced) wage value.Calculating the percentage (reduced) wage value is seen as an algorithm. The algorithm uses the following formula (in accordance with national practice): % pace x % quality x % net working time = % labour productivity.The application assists in going through the steps of the uniform wage value determination, checks whether information has been entered and checks whether data have been entered correctly. The wage value expert will provide an explanation in the advice, which also describes the development perspective and any interventions. Both the employee and the employer are given access to the report. The views of the employee and the employer are stated separately in the report. Only after approval of the report by the employee and the employer is it given final status. After the wage-value measurement has been carried out, the client is informed. PerformanceThe application generates a percentage of reduced labour productivity compared to a regular employee in accordance with national practice. It is also possible to determine the duration of the wage-value measurement and, if necessary, to give advice on support. To determine the wage values, an independent party, Blik op Werk, periodically checks whether the national method is being complied with. If in doubt about the measurement, independent advice can be requested from a client support organisation (in accordance with the national working method).","The percentage of wage-value reduction is calculated by the application but is always checked by the wage-value expert. A change in the percentage is possible if it appears that there is new information regarding any of the three variables (pace, quality and net working time).If there are changes in the employee's circumstances that may affect the wage value, the employer is obliged to cooperate in a new wage value survey. The report and the result of the measurement are always discussed with the person in question. This person must always agree to further use of the wage-value measurement. There is also the possibility of objecting to the measurement.Level of human control:human-in-the-loop","The employees who perform the wage-value determination are certified specialists for this purpose. The register wage-value experts carry out uniform wage-value measurements for benefit recipients according to a national procedure. There is little or no impact on the individual, in this case the employee, when carrying out the wage-value measurement. The employee receives the same salary regardless of the outcome of the wage value measurement. A lower percentage of wage value means more wage subsidy for the employer, a higher percentage of wage value results in a lower wage subsidy. For this reason, the risk for the individual is low.Personal data and sensitive data play a role when performing the wage-value measurement. Given these risk factors, the data is handled very carefully and there are secure connections between the application for determining wage value and the municipality of Amsterdam. Also, the number of employees with access to the application and the associated personal data of the employee is limited as much as possible.

Risk Assessment Instrument Juvenile Criminal Justice (Ritax) ,Child Protection Board,The Ritax is part of the LIJ and is used for young people suspected of committing a crime. Ritax is a scientifically based risk assessment instrument. It allows a substantiated recommendation to be made for an intervention to prevent recidivism and encourage positive development of the young person.,,Law,,In use,"The RvdK provides criminal advice to the public prosecutor and the juvenile court for young people aged 12 to 18. The RvdK uses the Landelijk Instrumentarium Jeugdstrafrechtketen (LIJ), of which the Ritax is a part, in its investigation to provide the most appropriate punishment advice for the young person. The RvdK investigator talks to the young person, parents and often school. With this information, a questionnaire is completed. The RvdK produces a report containing the results of the Ritax and the advice. This report is given to the young person, the parents, the juvenile court and the public prosecutor.","Research shows that an estimate based on the results of a scientific instrument is better than the estimate based solely on the experience of the researcher. The calculation model behind the recidivism rates is based on scientific research on factors influencing juvenile recidivism. The outcome of the Ritax, together with the researcher's opinion, leads to the sentencing recommendation.","The basis for the RvdK's use of Ritax lies in their statutory duties. The duties that apply when using Ritax are set out in the Criminal Code (Sr) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (Sv). The advisory task in the event of a behaviour-influencing measure is described in article 77w, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code, the advisory task in the event of detention and early assistance is described in article 490 of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the advisory task in criminal cases of juveniles is described in articles 494/494a/498 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

All answers are accompanied by points. The Ritax adds up all the points. These points are assigned to risk groups. The answer categories of most questions have a scale ranging from no risk to high risk. The choice of scoring is scientifically based. Extensive analyses determined when the young person falls into very low/low/mid/high/very high risk or protection for each topic. The outcome is made visible in a diagram where the risk factors and protective factors are shown in red and green for each subject. Using the young person's protective and risk factors, the Ritax looks at which punishment would be most appropriate, for example a learning punishment or supervision by the juvenile probation service. The RvdK investigator decides which punishment is ultimately recommended.","When using the Ritax, there is always human intervention. The RvdK researcher checks the outcome of the Ritax and whether it matches the young person's own impression. The researcher, in consultation with a colleague ('4-eye principle'), makes the final decision on the most appropriate punishment advice for the young person. ","The effectiveness of the Ritax is regularly tested scientifically. The results of these tests are checked by an independent scientific committee. The Ritax is only used by authorised, trained staff. Only relevant staff of the RvdK can look at the outcomes of the Ritax in the system.

A dangerous traffic situation or nuisance from people and catering establishments can also be reported. Previously, people had to choose which category their report fit best (e.g. 'nuisance' or 'street furniture'), so that the report went to the right department in the municipality. But the municipality is a complex organisation and the list of categories is long. As a result, people did not always choose the right category. This sometimes caused delays in processing notifications. Therefore, we now use an algorithm that recognises words, e.g. 'rubbish' and 'pavement'. On this basis, it determines which category the report best fits and which department should handle it. So the caller no longer has to choose a category, and the call is handled faster because it goes to the right department.",,,,1.0.0,,,Algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Reports The dataset consists of reports made previously (free text field). Initially, we used 300,000 notifications from past years to train the algorithm. It is regularly retrained with new notifications and implemented corrections to existing notifications. If the Action Service Centre or departments see an incorrect categorisation, (see Human Monitoring) they correct it manually in the notification system. These corrections are used in re-training. We are investigating whether re-training the algorithm can be automated in the future. We cannot disclose this dataset in this registry. Because the data comes from a free text field, it may contain personal data, even though this is explicitly not requested. Email address and phone number for follow-up questions Someone who makes a report can leave his or her phone number and/or email address if he or she wishes. We will then keep the reporter informed of progress and have the option of calling him or her back. This information is not kept longer than necessary for this purpose and is therefore not used by the algorithm. For other information on processing personal data, see: https://www.amsterdam.nl/privacy/specifieke/privacyverklaringen-wonen/meldingen-overlast-privacy","Architecture of the model The text of the notification is divided into individual words. Each word in a notification is analysed to see how unique it is to that notification, compared to the total collection of words ('TF-IDF' or 'term frequency-inverse document frequency'). A word like 'the' or 'thank you' is therefore given a low weight and a word like 'rubbish' is given a higher weight. From that combination of words, logistic regression (a machine-learning technique) is then used to determine which category the report belongs to and thus which department within the municipality the report is most likely to belong to.",All reports categorised with less than 40% certainty are forwarded to the Action Service Centre. A human assessment then takes place and the report is still categorised. Reports that are wrongly forwarded to an incorrect category are also manually placed in the correct category by the responsible department (sometimes via the Action Service Centre).,"There are few risks in this algorithm. It places a notification in the right category and gets it to the attention of the right department faster. If the algorithm cannot place a notification in a category with sufficient certainty, it ends up in the 'Other' category. Staff at the Action Service Centre review those reports and manually put them in the right category. If the algorithm does not work properly, it therefore takes a little longer for the report to reach the right department. The reporter can add personal data if he or she wants to be kept informed. This data is stored securely and not used by the algorithm.",,ReportsComplaintsNatural language processing,,,,,,,,Impactful algorithms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Support Income Settlement Assistance (OIB),Municipality of Amsterdam,"If someone receives social assistance benefits, other income must be offset against the benefits. This is because the assistance supplements income up to the assistance standard.",,Social Security,https://algoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/ai-system/ondersteuning-inkomstenverrekening-bijstand-oib/1147/,In development,"If someone receives social assistance benefits, other income must be offset against the benefits. This is because the assistance supplements income up to the assistance standard. The Income Offset Assistance (OIB) support helps create a complete picture of this income. With information from the Inlichtingenbureau, this functionality allows us to set off the net income against the benefit.The municipality of Amsterdam has a statutory duty to pay the benefit correctly. Anyone who receives or applies for social assistance benefits has a duty to provide information. The Participation Act obliges the benefit recipient to provide all the information the municipality needs to determine the right to assistance. A change in income must therefore be reported to the municipality of Amsterdam. The municipality of Amsterdam sends a monthly paper income declaration to a benefit recipient who receives income from work. The benefit recipient must return the completed income declaration and indicate whether the income differs from the income data known to the municipality. The benefit recipient must also provide a payslip so that the income consultant can set off the correct amounts. This is error-prone and often causes a lot of stress for the benefit recipient.Settling income quickly and correctly is in the interest of both the welfare recipient and the municipality. Settlement of income should not create a barrier for a benefit recipient to start working. This is why the municipality has designed the Income Settlement Assistance Support (OIB).The main purpose of the OIB is to simplify services for the benefit recipient. The functionality retrieves the income data of Amsterdam benefit recipients from the Inlichtingenbureau. A paper income declaration is then no longer needed. Tests and a pilot in 2021, showed that the data from the Inlichtingenbureau are reliable and can be used for this application. The municipality of Amsterdam is allowed to use this data as it concerns residents on welfare benefits. With this data, the process is more efficient and less error-prone. It reduces the risk of incorrect settlement or late reporting of income. ",,,,1.0.0,,,Algoritmen@amsterdam.nl,nld,,"Dataset descriptionThe dataset contains only people who receive subsistence benefits from the municipality of Amsterdam and receive income from employment, and/or benefits and pensions. The Inlichtingenbureau dataset uses a component code that allows us to identify the type of income involved.Furthermore, the dataset describes the following data: Component codeName of employer; Taxable wage; Net wage; Use of wage tax credit;  Holiday pay reservation;BSNA (processor) agreement has been concluded with the supplier Wigo4it. Founded in 2007 by the four largest cities in the Netherlands (Amsterdam, The Hague, Rotterdam and Utrecht), Wigo4it has jointly developed a functionality to offset income data against benefits in the income system Socrates. This application is used to apply for and provide welfare and income benefits, among other things.Data collected by: Municipality of AmsterdamEmployee Insurance Agency (UWV)Sociale Verzekeringsbank (SVB)BelastingdienstIntelligence Bureau (IB) (no source holder, but responsible for technical infrastructure provided by the Bureau Keteninformatisering Werk en Inkomen (BKWI))Type of data:Financial information, income from employment or pension, of Amsterdam residents on welfare benefits. Information that an income counsellor needs to be able to offset the income of benefit recipients against the (welfare) benefit.","Description of the system architectureThe Amsterdam municipality retrieves a file from the Inlichtingenbureau via a secure portal on a monthly basis. With this, we determine whether people with too low income or assets qualify for benefits or additional provisions, such as special assistance. The Inlichtingenbureau receives the data from the Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen (UWV), the Sociale Verzekeringsbank (SVB) and the Belastingdienst.After this, the municipality of Amsterdam delivers the file to the supplier of the income system. They load the following data into the income system:Income category (component code)Type of incomePeriodicityEmployer/institution/personPayroll tax numberReservation VTWage tax credit appliedAfter this, the income system adds the data from the file to the customer's file. Then the income offset calculation can be made to determine what portion of the benefit should be paid. Earlier, we did this based on the income statement of the benefit recipient.The income offset is performed only if the above fields are filled correctly. The income statement differs from one employer to another, making it specialist work to properly read the information provided.If the data is entered correctly, the income system makes a proposal for the income to be offset. An income consultant from the Amsterdam municipality assesses the proposal. In case of (large) deviations compared to the previous month, the municipality contacts the welfare recipient to discuss the difference. If necessary, the income consultant will adjust the data before the settlement is carried out.If the data are not entered correctly, an income consultant from the Amsterdam municipality will manually enter or complete them. For this, the income consultant will receive a work order in the benefit system. After the income consultant fills in or completes the data, the income system still calculates which part of the benefit should be paid to the citizen so that the citizen's income is supplemented to the benefit level.The result of the settled income is reflected in the benefit statement for the month in question. The benefit specification is a decision. About the specification, the benefit recipient can always ask for an explanation or clarification. If there is a mistake in the settlement, it can always be corrected by the income counsellor.Performance:Between February 2022 and February 2024 and additional research done. This showed that the data is reliable and up-to-date and can therefore be used for income settlement. For benefit recipients who receive income alongside their benefits, in the near future it will no longer be mandatory to submit income online or manually. This obligation often creates uncertainty and problems, as benefit recipients are unable to provide this information in time or the information provided by the benefit recipient is incomplete. Incorrect completion can also affect the family's total benefit. For example, in the case where part of the family is employed and part of the family is not.The data from the Intelligence Bureau and the offsetting of income by the income system makes the offsetting of income more reliable. The way it is calculated and the final end result remain the same.","Sometimes the Information Bureau data do not lead to a proposal for an amount to be offset in the income system. For example, when someone starts working for the first time or if someone receives more than EUR 150 than the previous month. In those cases, the benefit recipient is always contacted. As in the manual process, the income counsellor makes the final decision. As a result, the final outcome can be adjusted at any time and the impact for the benefit recipient is low. The income counsellors of the Amsterdam municipality use the income system, which processes the data from the Inlichtingenbureau. They can adjust the data in the income system at the request of the benefit recipient. The income consultant makes the final judgement on the data provided by the Inlichtingenbureau. The data from the Intelligence Bureau serves as support and to improve the reliability of the data.Level of human control:human-in-the-loop","The process has a low risk of errors that may affect a benefit recipient's ongoing entitlement. As soon as a difference in income is detected, the income consultant discusses it with the benefit recipient. Currently, this is the case in about 30 per cent of cases. Based on the discussion, and any additional information, the actual income is recorded in the file used for the income calculation. The development of this functionality involves personal data, combined datasets, and data processed on a large scale. Given these risk factors, the data is handled very carefully and there are secure connections between the Inlichtingenbureau, the Amsterdam municipality and Wigo4it. The number of employees accessing the functionality is as limited as possible.Mitigation:If the data from the Intelligence Bureau do not match or contain ambiguities, an income consultant discusses this with the benefit recipient. The functionality is still under development and the income system cannot currently produce a proposal for settlement for every benefit recipient. Currently, about 75 per cent of incomes are processed through OIB. If necessary, the data is further examined and the actual income is manually recorded in the file used for income calculation.The Intelligence Bureau is involved in data processing. This data delivery is regulated in article 64 paragraph 4 of the Participation Act. The Suwi Decree in article 5.24 paragraph 3 states that the Intelligence Agency and the college are jointly responsible for the processing.Wigo4it is also involved in implementing the process. Wigo4it regularly conducts 'pen and hack tests' to check that the Socrates income system cannot be hacked by third parties. Socrates is the IT system that ensures welfare recipients receive the correct benefit. Wigo4it is ISO certified, which means that the risk of a data leak is low.

Early on,Municipality of Zundert,"In Zundert, we fight against poverty. We try to help people at risk of poverty as early as possible to prevent them from getting into serious debt or being evicted.",,Social Security,,In use,"In Zundert, we fight against poverty. We try to help people at risk of poverty as early as possible to prevent them from getting into serious debt or being evicted. When problems are still small, advice or a light intervention can be enough. To do that, we need to know who is at risk of getting into debt. That is why we get a notification from health insurers, housing associations, energy suppliers, water companies and some public authorities, among others, if they have a customer who is in arrears with them.  That the creditor may pass this data to the municipality, including personal data, is stated in the Municipal Debt Assistance Act. After the notification, the municipality supplements the data with information known to us about the reported person. This is information that is needed to determine whether or not someone is a benefit recipient, a client of WPI (the Work, Participation and Income Department of the municipality of Amsterdam) and to determine the best care provider to forward the notification to. Supplementing the notification with the information known to the municipality is done automatically, at the press of a button. Someone is always needed to trigger a check for data. The system forwards the notification to a counsellor at the municipality. He or she tries to get in touch with the citizen within 14 days and makes an initial analysis within 28 days. Sometimes there is more at play than arrears. If the citizen accepts help, we make detailed arrangements with him or her. The social worker reports to the central hotline what agreements have been made, so that a creditor knows what the next steps are for the payment arrears.",,,,1.0.0,,,gemeente@zundert.nl,nld,,"Creditor notification Creditors make their notification of arrears in a specially developed registration and information system called 'RIS Matching'. The data in this dataset are all data needed to address the right citizen, find the right care provider and provide advice on which help the citizen would benefit most. Only health insurers have a legal basis (Government Gazette 2015) for supplying the BSN, the other creditors do not supply a BSN.  The creditor can provide the following information with the notification:  Customer number Early or crisis Debt amount Term Amount Gender Pre-letters Prefix Surname Street House number House letter House number or suffix Postcode City BSN (in case of health insurance) Date of birth Additional information (e.g. which 'label' someone is insured with. The main label is Achmea, but someone may be insured with Zilveren Kruis, Avero, FBTO, for example. Contact details such as telephone number or e-mail address are also listed here if this is known). A municipal employee links the creditor's notification to the data warehouse. Via the data warehouse, information can be retrieved from various databases so that we can determine which social worker can start working on the report. The list below shows exactly what information is involved. The following information, if known and if it concerns a client of WPI, is linked from the data warehouse to the notification. The information is needed not only to link the right social worker to the notification, but also for the social worker to start the conversation with the customer together with the right customer manager: ","Architecture of the model The creditor makes a notification in the registration and information system 'RIS Matching'. Once every fortnight, a municipality employee links all new notifications (at the push of a button) to data on the reported person from the Poverty Reduction Department's data warehouse and to data on the various debt assistance programmes available. That link allows the municipality to determine whether it is dealing with the right citizen and which social worker is best placed to contact the citizen. It then checks whether there are multiple debt arrears within one household. Up to this point, the process is automated. Next, there are a few options: For a single payment arrears of less than 250 euros, a text message, letter or e-mail is automatically sent from RIS Matching (depending on which contact details are available). Here, citizens can find debt assistance in their district. They can then contact them there themselves.If the debt exceeds EUR 250, the notification is automatically forwarded, based on information about the postcode area, to a social worker in the appropriate district or at a WPI department. The social worker tries to contact the citizen within 14 days. The social worker makes an initial analysis within 28 days. Often there is more at play than arrears. If the citizen accepts help, detailed arrangements are made with him or her.If it is not clear from the data whether the person in debt is known to the Poverty Department, the case is marked in the system as 'unclear' and passed on to the Vroeg eropaf team. In the exceptional case that a report does not reach a social worker in the right district, the social worker reports this to the RIS Matching system manager. The latter then transfers the report to the correct care worker.","The system makes a number of choices independently (automated), for example to send a text message, email or letter in case of arrears lower than 250 euros, or to which postcode area the notification should be forwarded. During the data linking process, there is one moment of human supervision: the linking of the creditors' notification with the data of the Poverty Reduction Department is automated, but human action is required to start the linking. From the moment the notification is forwarded to the social workers in the appropriate district, the process is no longer automated. The social service provider visits the reported citizen if the citizen does not contact them himself.","The registration and information system called 'RIS Matching' is provided by the company Inforing, a company that supplies this system to 200 municipalities. They regularly carry out so-called 'pen and hack tests' to check that the system cannot be hacked by third parties. They also ensure that personal data is securely managed and not sold to third parties. Security also lies with Inforing. The security meets the BIO standard. Citizens can indicate at any time that they do not want to be listed in the system. The data are then immediately removed. In addition, citizens can access the system at any time. This concerns dataset 4, 'linked data' (see: Data). Other rules apply to the data in the data warehouse of the Poverty Reduction Department, namely the Urban Framework for Processing Personal Data and the General Data Protection Regulation. The data warehouse and debt arrears reports are two separate systems and debt arrears reports do not enter the data warehouse. The moment the municipality has to remove the data from the RIS Matching system, no debt arrears information remains with the municipality.

Public space notification,Municipality of Oldambt,"Residents can report through an online reporting system if something needs to be fixed or cleaned up in the public space (e.g. street or park). If the municipality is responsible for this, it will be dealt with. ",,"Traffic, Space and Infrastructure, Public Order and Safety",,In use,"Previously, reporters themselves had to choose to which main and subcategory their report best fitted, so that the report went to the right department of the municipality. Thanks to the algorithm, this is no longer necessary; the (sub)category is determined on the basis of the report text and the report is automatically classified. This saves the notifier (the resident) work and the employee too, since (usually) without any intermediate steps the notification goes straight to the team that has to deal with it. ",The reason for using the algorithm is the efficiency gains it makes.  ,,,1.0.0,,,info@gemeente-oldambt.nl,nld,,"Notification texts are used for the algorithm. While making a report, the reporter can choose to leave a phone number or e-mail address on a new page, but this information is only used for providing feedback on status changes. This information is not kept longer than necessary for this purpose, nor is it used for the algorithm.","The text of the notification is broken down into individual words. Each word from a notification is analysed to see how unique it is to that notification, compared to the total collection of words ('TF-IDF' or 'term frequency-inverse document frequency'). As a result, a word like 'the' or 'thank you' gets a low weight and a word like 'rubbish' gets a higher weight. From that combination of words, logistic regression (a machine-learning technique) is then used to determine which category the report belongs to.","Notifications do not always end up in the right category and the algorithm also does not always recognise which category the notification should go in (and then puts it in the Other category). In those cases, the notification still has to be put in the right category manually.","There are few risks in this algorithm. Small risk is that the algorithm puts a report in the wrong category. In that case, a reporter may get follow-up questions that have nothing to do with the report made. In that case, the reporter is always given the option that the questions are not applicable, but could cause confusion.",,,,2023-12,,,,,,Other algorithms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Zivver,Municipality of Oldambt,This algorithm helps e-mail users determine when an e-mail contains sensitive information and should be sent securely.,,Organisation and business operations,,In use,"The purpose of this algorithm is to help ensure that information sent by e-mail is properly secured. In other words: not with too few security measures, but not with too many either. The algorithm contributes to this by alerting e-mail senders to sensitive information and encouraging them to then send this information securely. If they choose to do so, the e-mail is secured with encryption, two-factor authentication for the recipient, revocation option and logging. This ensures that sensitive information is secured, while insensitive information can be accessed without additional friction for the recipient. The algorithm only impacts the process of sending e-mails and does not affect the substantive legal status of citizens or businesses.","The use of this algorithm helps ensure that e-mails are sent with the right level of security. Classification of e-mails by algorithm is more effective than classification based on a glossary compiled by human input or classification by the sender, while at the same time the algorithm does not affect the content of an e-mail.",,,1.0.0,,,info@gemeente-oldambt.nl,nld,,"The algorithm is based on anonymised historical messages combined with whether or not these messages were sent securely. Anonymisation is done in several steps, with only aggregates across many thousands of messages being stored. In addition, personal data is automatically removed from the data. With this, the data is anonymised and the original messages are impossible to extract from the data.","When composing a new e-mail, the terms in the message and attachments are used to see how similar it is to previously (securely or normally) sent e-mails. If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is marked as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal. The moment the e-mail is classified as sensitive and is about a topic that the organisation has set to be sent securely, the user is given a recommendation to send the e-mail securely. ","In principle, the user makes the choice whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the recommendation by the algorithm. It is also possible to automate the choice of whether or not to send an e-mail securely based on the algorithm. In that case, a user can still choose to explicitly send an e-mail securely by himself.","The overall performance of the algorithm is monitored by the supplier.

The result of the elaboration of these policy rules are the target group codes with the various measures (collection strategies). The municipality chooses the best way to quickly get in touch with the Rotterdammer with tax debt. That is why there are different measures. For this, the municipality looks at payment behaviour over the past 3 years. This is done on the basis of the collection costs imposed: have reminders and/or penalty notices been sent before. The tax debtor is in target group code 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 or 7. The criteria for being in a particular target group are the same for everyone.

The points have x, y, z coordinates, a colour and intensity.The points are first semantically segmented and then clustered into individual lamp posts. To train the model, a subset of the data was used, from 50 pieces in Amsterdam East. This subset was annotated. This was partly done automatically and then corrected by a human. Initial tests were carried out in Weesp and the Oosterpark neighbourhood in Amsterdam Oost. The final operational model uses the dataset of the whole of Amsterdam. For the automatic annotation, we also use AHN4 and BGT data to determine, for example, the land and location of buildings.Licence: right of use within the municipalityOperatingPersonal data:No personal dataSource:Street LiDAR | Cyclomedia","Description of the system architecture:The first step is the semantic segmentation of point clouds. Here, we classify points into regions based on their meaning. We determine whether something is part of a lamppost or not. For this, we use RandLA-Net (QingyongHu/RandLA-Net (github.com)). The next step is to cluster all points that belong to lampposts. We use connected-component labelling for this purpose. We remove noise and eventually arrive at pieces of point clouds that belong to an individual lamppost. For each cluster found, we use prinicipal component analysis to create a fit for each lamp post. From this fit, we can easily derive the properties of the pole. The code for these last two steps can be found on our github: Amsterdam-AI-Team/Urban_PointCloud_Analysis PerformancePerformance first step in data processing (semantic segmentation with RandLA-Net): the intersection-over-union for the lamppost class is 82. Performance second step (identifying individual lampposts): a significant proportion (about a third) of the lampposts found are in reality not lampposts (false positives). These are picked out by humans (see heading 'human monitoring').Performance third step (fit per lamp post): in 91 per cent of cases the fit was correct and in the remaining 9 per cent was corrected by a human.","Each found lamp post (and its associated fit) is checked by a human. The information about the found lamp posts that are easy to match with the existing registration is automatically included in this registration. The found lamp posts that are not so easy to match with the existing registration are checked again in more detail by experts, before the information about these posts is used.Level of human control: human-in-command","The system is low risk because the data is not very sensitive and the outcomes are checked by people before we use them.

If the e-mail is sufficiently similar to messages normally sent securely, the e-mail is marked as potentially sensitive. Based on the terminology in the e-mail, it is determined whether it relates to a specific category of sensitive information, such as medical or legal.

Improved bicycle traffic flow,Municipality of Delft,The Bicycle Platoon Module consists of both smart software and a camera. The module ensures a smooth flow of cyclists. ,,Space and Infrastructure,www.delft.nl,In use,Properly prioritise cycle traffic so that all traffic flows better.,"Traffic participants within the Municipality of Delft experience heavy traffic on a daily basis. In its traffic policy (Mobiliteitsplan Delft 2040), the Municipality of Delft has indicated how it will implement the principle of Sustainable Accessibility. Among other things, this will be done by using Intelligent Traffic Systems (ITS). To achieve the smooth flow of bicycle traffic, software is linked to sensors and cameras. That software makes real-time, on-the-spot decisions about which traffic participants get priority. This is done with a data set that is as limited as possible and is only available in real-time, at the moment itself, and is not stored anywhere. ","Road Traffic Act A road is managed and maintained by a road authority. From the Road Traffic Act follows this legal duty for the road manager.Art 18 section 1 lists who is authorised to manage a particular road. For roads not under the management of the state, the province or a water board, this is the Municipal Executive. The starting point in making traffic decisions is the smooth flow of traffic. The road authority is responsible for the availability and safe use of the physical road infrastructure and for managing it using a variety of means and tools. These are physical and digital means. Physical means should include signs, information panels, induction loops, cameras, traffic lights. Digitally recognisable resources should consider detection and operation including control scenarios, traffic intensities, TMC feeds, road sign databases and National Roads Database.Making a variety of digital tools and data types externally available for use in the private domain is a practice that emerged from about 2010 and will continue to grow in the future.",,1.0.0,,,privacy@delft.nl,nld,,Camera images; v-log data; traffic count,"The algorithm is part of the Bicycle Peloton Module (FPM). The Bicycle Platoon Module consists of both smart software and a camera. The aim is to ensure smooth traffic flow at a given traffic light. The camera is aimed at an area tens of metres away from that traffic light. The software linked to the camera predicts whether cyclists, when they arrive at the traffic light, form a group of at least three cyclists right after each other. If that is the prediction, the cyclists are marked as a 'platoon'. The traffic light jumps to green and the cyclists are given clearance. The software calculates the speed of the cyclists based on the camera images. This also predicts how long the light should be green for the group of cyclists. The advantage is that the traffic light is never too long or too short. Cyclists need to stop less often but other traffic can also flow smoothly.The images are processed real-time on the camera by the software. The images are not stored or transmitted.

And assesses whether you meet the training and experience requirements for the job.If the labour expert has found enough suitable jobs for you, the CBBS calculates what you can still earn. This is done by comparing the wages of the suitable jobs with the wages you earned before you became ill.The outcome of this comparison is the disability percentage.

We prepare changes carefully. We do this with a large number of experts. Think of lawyers, designers, builders, testers, insurance doctors and labour experts. We always test implemented changes in CBBS extensively. Only when the system has successfully passed the tests will we take it into use again.","Only with proper knowledge of the CBBS can our staff properly assess your disability. For example, it is important that they understand definitions used. Or know how the system links functions to persons. Therefore, they can only work independently with the system if they have followed training and obtained a certificate. In case of major changes, refresher training takes place. We also regularly train our occupational analysts. And manuals are available for users and staff involved in algorithm development.The following measures ensure the prevention of discrimination:CBBS uses only data necessary to assess the work disability of someone with a disease or disability.The algorithm compares jobs according to fixed rules that apply to everyone.UWV uses the CBBS in the same way for everyone.

The algorithm BNA gives signals only after the reminder and before the enforcement order. After the enforcement order, the DM algorithm checks whether a person with a tax debt has sufficient (new) income or property that the Tax Administration can seize. Is a person with a tax debt expected to have sufficient (new) income or property? Then a signal is sent to a Tax Administration employee who assesses the situation.

TenderTrends,Netherlands Enterprise Agency,"TenderTrends is a model that searches for relevant tenders based on entered keywords and filters and displays data from these. For instance, if the words 'grass', 'mowing' and 'trees' are entered, tenders containing one or more of these words will appear. The user can convert a selection of tenders into charts. ",,Organisation and business operations,tenderned.nl,In development,"The purpose of this algorithm is to support contracting authorities in their tender preparation process. It does this by providing insights into similar tenders.This goal is achieved in a number of steps:The contracting authority prepares the tender by formulating the needs, requirements, characteristics and other issues. Next, the contracting authority can consult TenderTrends by entering keywords and specifying additional criteria (e.g. type of contracting authority: 'municipality').The user receives a list of potentially relevant tenders based on his search query.From this list, the user selects the most relevant tenders in his situation. This will return a summary of historical key figures (average number of questions from market players, average turnaround time, most frequently selected procedures, etc.) and public contact data belonging to these selected tenders.Users can apply this data to their own tenders to make more appropriate choices in advance. The user can also contact colleagues to gain experiences.The impact of TenderTrends is mainly noticeable in applying public funds more efficiently and offering more insights to contracting authorities. Furthermore, TenderTrends possibly supports in more diverse procurement by showing alternative procedures of similar tenders. No negative impact has been noted to TenderTrends because:its use is optional;no confidential information (personal or company data) is shown;the contracting authority always makes the decisions itself.Furthermore, tenders can be drafted more clearly for entrepreneurs from the beginning. This contributes to the ease of tendering. A possible example: a new tender was drafted with TenderTrends where the contracting authority noticed that many questions were asked in historical tenders (data from TenderTrends). The contracting authority then investigated this further and resolved some of the common questions in advance by establishing clear communication and requirements. Subsequently, market players no longer need to ask a question about this and can proceed with the tender.There is no direct impact for citizens and businesses.","TenderNed has taken into account the questions: 'what is allowed?', 'what is possible?' and 'what is desirable?'. Legal and ethical questions were also taken into account.From this, points such as privacy, propriety, responsibility emerged. For each of the possible risks, steps were taken to minimise the negative impact. An example is sensitive procurement information. Here, it was decided to use only publicly accessible tenders.Another measure is Human in the loop (HITL), or the human who sits at the knobs of the model and ultimately chooses which data is relevant for the summary. The model is unsupervised, meaning the model is trained without knowing what is right or wrong. The model looks purely at how many words match and which ones are most informative. This means that the word 'grass' is more informative than 'tender' because the word 'tender' appears in almost all texts. In the case of TenderTrends, this means that what the model predicts may be statistically correct, but the results will not always be relevant to the user. We periodically perform internal validation by testing a number of searches and manually determining whether they are really relevant. Also, the end user always makes the final decision so that the relevance of the summarised data is ensured. For example, the model can predict that a search about plant maintenance is very similar to embankment maintenance. The end user can then notice this and ignore this 'prediction'.Each of the risks found are resolved or avoided. The risks were also discussed with various domain experts (users, lawyers, etc.).The trade-off that remained after resolving the risks was whether to deploy TenderTrends or continue with the current state of affairs, without TenderTrends. The choice was made to continue because TenderTrends:is optional, the contracting authority is not obliged to use TenderTrends.does not carry a negative impact. It is a non-directive, neutral application that only provides insights.potentially saves public money. Information on comparable tenders can be collected faster.Furthermore, even after conducting the Impact Assessment for Human Rights when deploying Algorithms (IAMA), it was found that there is no negative impact. ",,,1.0.0,,,https://www.rvo.nl/onderwerpen/contact/formulier,nld,,"Data used for the algorithm are: the names of all Dutch public tenders, their descriptions and contracting authorities.

The user then has the option to further select the notices relevant to them. This selection is then converted into insights for the user through graphs and tables (e.g. average number of lots).The language model is trained with historical and public data of tenders. The title and description of tenders were pasted together. Then typical Dutch stop words were removed from the text (e.g. de, het, een, zoals, omdat). With the remaining texts, a dictionary was created in which all words were counted. Finally, a number emerges from the model indicating whether a word contains a lot of information (a high number) or little information (a low number). The more often a word is used the lower the number. These numbers are recalculated after a certain amount of time. Calculating these numbers is the self-learning part. ","Within this model, there is human intervention. Briefly, the model works as follows:The user enters search terms himself.The model calculates relevance of all historical tenders in the dataset.The model presents a maximum number of relevant tenders (the user determines the maximum number) including the amount of agreement from 0 (no agreement) to 100 (full agreement).The user sees the title, description, and procurement category of each tender.Based on this information, the user can select the tenders to be analysed about.The application (not the algorithm) produces a number of graphs of the selected tenders based on the key figures present (lead time, price, procedure, number of questions, etc.).Herein, it becomes clear that the TenderTrends application consists of 3 parts in total: the search, the pre-selection by the algorithm, and finally, the human intervention.This split ensures that the user has a lot of control over the analysis and can work with it himself. At the front end (the search), the user defines requirements (mandatory keywords, region of tender, etc.). The model searches more than 50,000 historical tenders and shows the most important results. The user evaluates the results and includes the relevant tenders in the analysis. The path after this analysis lies further with the contracting authority. However, TenderTrends does offer ","The following mitigating measures have been taken within the model:The user makes a selection of the actually relevant tenders prior to the data analysis. This ensures human intervention and checks which data the model bases the analysis on.TenderTrends only displays and uses publicly available data. This prevents sensitive information from being included in the model and thus becoming publicly available.The model uses a 'local dataset' that is free of sensitive information. Thus, the model does not communicate directly with an internal database. With this, there are fewer inter-system dependencies (database must be approachable) and there is no risk of an attack on the database (information security). Other mitigating measures include things like the way data is presented so that it is more accessible to the user. The best example is the output of the model, which is a static score that is difficult to understand for people not at home in the field of language data. The choice was made to rename the score to 'degree of similarity' and display it as a filled bar. The fuller the bar the greater the similarity to the query.

Then, vegetation recordings are read into ITERATIO for analysis. An indicator value is attached to some of the occurring species. A series of iterative calculations produces an indicator value for all species, and an average value for the terrain condition for all recordings. The different vegetation types are usually underpinned by a number of recordings.In ITERATIO, each vegetation type has been assigned a value for terrain condition. These values are associated with each patch of the vegetation map and made visible through colours in the abiotic value map.Apart from easily processing the mappings prepared according to the Digital Standard with ITERATIO 2, it also provides for the import of GeoPackage output from the National Database Vegetation and Habitats (NDVH). By linking to the NDVH, analysing large numbers of vegetation mappings with ITERATIO will start to structurally contribute to broadening and deepening our knowledge of natural sites for their conservation, management and restoration.",There is no direct policy consequence of using ITERATIO.

Image recognition Image matching: previously treated damages,Groningen Mining Damage Institute,Automated recognition of previously assessed claims to avoid re-treating past claims.,,"Law, Nature and Environment",https://www.schadedoormijnbouw.nl/,In use,"A claims expert has to perform a manual test to see if a claim has been handled before. An expert does this by comparing photos from a claim report with photos from old reports. Assessing whether a damage has been treated before is a time-consuming and error-prone process. The Mining Damage Institute Groningen has therefore developed an algorithm to support the expert in this process.Purpose: the algorithm supports a damage expert in determining whether a damage has been previously assessed by the Institute Mining Damage Groningen (hereafter: the Institute) or its predecessors, such as NAM or the Safe Housing Centre. According to Article 2(4) of the Temporary Groningen Act, the Institute is not legally authorised to assess a damage if it has previously dealt with damage.Impact: The algorithm tells an expert whether the newly recorded damage matches a damage already known to the Institute. The algorithm does not combine personal characteristics, aspects and/or circumstances of you as an individual to arrive at an assessment. Only damages shown in the photos are compared.",Assessing whether a claim has been previously handled is a time-consuming and error-prone process.

Providing assistance in investigating whether foreign nationals in contact with the Dutch government have previously been registered in the Basisvoorziening Vreemdelingen. The Basisvoorziening Vreemdelingen is the central information system used by the organisations working together in the migration chain. The system contains basic data on foreigners and is maintained by the chain partners in the migration chain. Searching whether someone is already registered can prevent people from being registered multiple times. The algorithm to search phonetically can be applied if a person is not found based on fingerprints, or if foreigners do not have an identity document.

","The algorithm can be used to search for data of persons whose details are not well known. This can lead to better identification of foreigners. By entering data as it sounds, the algorithm is used to find the possible correct spelling of the data. This will help an employee if the language or letters do not match the Dutch alphabet.

Reinforcement scenario consideration for homes not meeting safety standard,National coordinator Groningen,"If homes are not declared at standard, a recommendation for a strengthening scenario is automatically created. The scenario depends on the market value of the current house and the cost of structural strengthening or demolition and new construction.",,"Living, Public Order and Safety, Space and Infrastructure",https://www.nationaalcoordinatorgroningen.nl/versterken/versterking-in-stappen/fase-4-planvorming/versterkingsmogelijkheden 	,In use,The purpose of the calculation is to outline a scenario for the resident to bring homes that are not at standard to standard. The impact is to be able to give clear advice on the strengthening path to follow.,"The benefits consist of as fair and equal a consideration framework as possible when deciding on a particular reinforcement. NCG is transparent about this.The disadvantages are in the changes in the assessment framework over time due to advancing insight and/or policy changes.Because the advantages largely outweigh the disadvantages, it is reasonable to use this algorithm in NCG's assessment framework. In addition, this approach makes it explainable to property owners, residents and citizens.",The basis for this algorithm is a policy choice made in December 2017 and described in the 'multi-year letter'.,,1.0.0,,,iv@nationaalcoordinatorgroningen.nl	,nld,,Building reinforcement investment cost (BKV): the cost of the reinforcement measures and ancillary works required according to the reinforcement advice to bring the building up to standard (read: safe):The rebuilding value: the total cost to demolish the current building and rebuild a functionally equivalent and earthquake-resistant building.The market value: the value of the building on the housing market without the value of the land on which the building stands.,"The scenario consideration aims to generate a scenario for the owner on how to bring a sub-standard building back up to standard, within the financial possibilities offered by the need for strengthening. There are basically two methods of addressing an existing building that is not up to standard:1.    The first method is to reinforce the existing building with structural modifications.2.    The second method is the alternative, which is to demolish the existing building and replace it with a new earthquake-resistant building. The financial equation underlying the scenario concerns the market value (MW) of a property plus the investment cost of structural strengthening (BKV) relative to the rebuilding value (HBW). The MW is constructed by subtracting the land value from the WOZ. After entering the basic data, an automatic ratio calculation is started comparing BKV with the HBW and the MW. Deviations above 20% are automatically forwarded to an expert for recalculation. If it falls directly within the ratio, or after checking with the building expert, the values are used to arrive at the correct reinforcement scenario:- Scenario A Structural strengthening: 110% BKV &lt; 100% HBW and 110% BKV &lt;= 100% MW- Scenario B structural strengthening: 110% B/C &lt; 100% HBW and 110% B/C &gt; 100% MW &lt;= 150% MW- Scenario C Structural strengthening or alternative: 110% B/C &lt; 100% HBW and 110% B/C &gt; 150% MW- Scenario D Structural strengthening or alternative: 110% BTC &gt;= 100% HBW &lt;= 150% HBW- Scenario E Bespoke solution: 110% BTC &gt; 150% HBW Scenario A - If the BKV investment costs are lower than the MW and lower than the HBW, there is no choice. Then structural strengthening according to the strengthening advice is the only option.Scenario B - If the BKV investment costs are higher than the MW but lower than 150% of the MW and lower than the HBW there is no choice. Then structural strengthening according to the strengthening advice is the only option.Scenario C - If the BKV investment cost is higher than 150% of the MW but lower than the rebuilding value, the owner has the choice of either structural strengthening according to the strengthening advice or choosing an alternative. If the alternative of demolition and new construction is chosen, the owner is responsible for contributing the difference between the investment cost of BKV and the HBW to enable new construction. The owner can also choose not to make a (or a lower) own contribution available, but to build back a cheaper building (smaller or with less functionality) with the available budget. The new building to be built must comply with the applicable building regulations and therefore also be earthquake-proof. For additional costs, such as temporary accommodation, owners are expected to contribute proportionally.Scenario D - If the investment cost BKV is higher than 150% of the MW and higher than the HBW, but lower than 150% of the HBW, the owner has the choice to either reinforce construction according to the reinforcement advice or choose an alternative. If the alternative of demolition and new construction is chosen, the NCG is fully responsible for the budget of this alternative and no own contribution is requested from the owner. A functionally similar building will be built within the legal preconditions. The new building to be built must meet the applicable building regulations and thus be earthquake-resistant. Additional costs, such as temporary accommodation, are borne by the NCG.Scenario E - If the investment costs BKV are higher than 150% of the HBW and 150% of the MW, the owner has the choice between an alternative such as demolition and new construction or purchase and demolition or for a tailor-made solution. If an alternative is chosen, the same rules apply as for scenario D. In the case of customisation, the available budget is 150% of the rebuilding value and a modification is sought to make the house earthquake-resistant even though the budget is lower than the calculated investment costs for structural reinforcement. After the scenario determination, a proposal is made by the NCG for the owner. In Scenarios A, B and C, the proposal is to carry out the reinforcement described in the reinforcement advice. In scenarios A and B that proposal is final, in scenario C the owner has the option of demolition and rebuilding. In scenarios D and E, the NCG's proposal is demolition and rebuilding. The owner has the alternative choice of still opting for structural strengthening or using the buy-sell scheme. After a discussion with the owner, the choice is registered in GHG. ","All scenario provisions involve advice that is always discussed by the resident supervisor with the owner/occupier. This does not involve fully automated decision-making.In addition, in doubtful cases, the construction expert always checks the calculation. Investment costs are an estimate of the total cost. The market value is determined on the basis of the WOZ value minus the land value. Experts may differ slightly in this.Technically, the calculation is as follows: (Investment cost / reconstruction value= 0.8 &lt; X &lt; 1.2) OR the ratio: (investment cost / market value = 0.8 &lt; X &lt; 1.2) it is recorded as different and passed on to the cost expert(s).","The risk is reduced, through human intervention by the resident supervisor and owner. In addition, a ratio is built in, as a result, if the ratio is exceeded, an additional cost expert is always consulted.

By this we mean that, as a municipality, we want to help our residents as early as possible when payment arrears begin. After all, payment arrears can be a predictor for the presence or emergence of financial problems or (problematic) debts. Many people in debt do not ask for help or do so very late. By catching them in time and offering help, we want to prevent arrears from increasing and developing into a problematic debt situation. It also helps reduce social costs for debt relief and ensures creditors get their money sooner. The impact of the algorithm itself is not that big. Based on legislation, early detection is a municipal task. The algorithm is an important tool for the municipality.

Population: the state population as of 1 January. This population is broken down by 1-year age group and gender. This is the starting population of this forecast.  Births: by year the number of births by mother's age. Mother's age should be given in 1-year groups (15-49 year olds). In connection with determining the sex ratio, it is important to show boys and girls separately.  Mortality: per year the number of deceased persons by 1-year age group and sex. Departure within the country: per year the number of persons leaving the city to a location within the Netherlands by 1-year age group and sex. Departure abroad: per year the number of persons departing from the city to a location outside the Netherlands by 1-year age group and gender.  Settlement in the Netherlands: per year the number of people settling in the city from the Netherlands by 1-year age group and sex.  Settlement abroad: per year the number of persons settling in the city from outside the Netherlands by 1-year age group and sex.  Housing stock and housing construction programme: the housing stock is based on the BAG housing stock as of 1 January. The housing construction programme is based on the new construction (including transformation) and demolition programme of mid-December (DSO/SEPO).  For the analysis and probability calculation of past events, data for at least 4 years of the variables should be entered. For the analysis of The Hague, the state data from the BRP from 1/1/1996 to 1 January of the most recent year available were used, and for the flow data the data from 1996 to the most recent year. These eight files are the basic data from which the city forecast is prepared. From these basic files, total domestic settlement and total domestic departure are calculated for each year. Furthermore, the balance of settlement minus departure is determined for each year. These data are needed to determine average settlement, average departure and settlement balance. These calculated values are used in the forecast to determine total domestic departures and to determine the correction factor for the domestic departure probability.  The probabilities From the base files, probabilities are calculated for each event by age and sex. The probabilities calculated are: an age-specific fertility probability, a mortality probability by age and sex, a domestic and foreign departure probability by age and sex, and a domestic and foreign settlement probability by age and sex. Correction factors When calculating probabilities, it is necessary to apply some corrections. The first correction concerns a correction of the settlement probabilities. The idea behind this is that an ageing population of the Netherlands will also produce a higher proportion of older settlers. The probabilities are corrected for the development per age group in the Dutch population as projected by CBS in 2019. Further corrections are given in the so-called correction matrix. This correction matrix is filled based on the specific Hague municipal situation in order to obtain a forecast that fits the municipality. The matrix consists of the following elements: - the fertility level, or Total fertility rate (Tfr) - the balance of domestic and foreign establishment (Salit and Salut) - the sex ratio (the ratio of boy to girl births).",,No,Results of the model are always analysed by specialists.,"Annually, the results of the forecast are compared with the realisation."

Because the prediction model does not make statements about individuals but about the use of facilities in neighbourhoods, there was no risk that the results from the model could violate the privacy of specific individuals. Furthermore, we only worked with neighbourhoods that were sufficiently large (more than 100 inhabitants) and where a sufficient number of people were using Youth Services (more than 70 users). One reason is that this does not allow for disclosure. That is, by combining characteristics, we cannot identify who the potential users of Youth Aid services are. Furthermore, when building the model, we weighed up together with the privacy officer and the ethical officer which variables could and could not be included from a privacy perspective. Here, the AVG was always the starting point. In addition, explainability of the model and the results is a relevant and decisive criterion. The question of what role bias plays in the use of the algorithm is far too general a question, as there are many forms of bias.

Calculating the WOZ value,Municipality of The Hague,"Determining and approving the WOZ value based on appraisal models and preparing an appraisal report. The status of 4Woz 2.0 is in production. In the municipality of The Hague, appraisal values will be determined with 4Woz for the first time in 2022. This valuation process is currently (November 2021) being designed. Currently, valuation is still done with similar valuation models within IBS (Integral Tax System), built by the municipality of The Hague itself.",Rules-based.,,"De code wordt niet openbaar gepubliceerd. De applicatie 4Woz is een standaard WOZ-taxatiesysteem van het bedrijf 4Value, dat ook door andere gemeenten in Nederland wordt gebruikt.",In use,"The 4Woz application supports in the valuation process for the implementation of the WOZ Act.  4Woz supports the management of property characteristics, the analysis of market data, the determination of appraisal values, the checking and approval of the appraisal values into (in IBS) WOZ values to be disposed of and the preparation of the appraisal report as substantiation of the WOZ value. In particular, the algorithms play a role in determining the appraisal values and preparing the appraisal report because these involve complex calculations and comparisons. The appraisal algorithm functions well when the value level is correct, the inter-value ratios are right and there is a reconciliation of the appraised values to the analysed market data. The appraisal report algorithm works well when appraisal reports make the appraised value plausible, e.g. by presenting all the property characteristics of the property itself, stating its own market data and (in the case of residential properties) referring to three comparable sold properties with a WOZ value.","There is no better alternative to 4Woz's algorithms. On the contrary, 4Woz itself is currently seen as an alternative to a traditional way of valuing where individual valuations can be made outside the IBS valuation model. In a completely traditional way of working, individual, municipal valuers each make their own interpretation of property characteristics and market data into an appraisal value. A computerised valuation model that works according to algorithms generally helps to make the analysis of market data, valuation of properties and substantiation through a valuation report much more consistent and unambiguous. The frequency of annual valuations and WOZ decisions is only possible thanks to algorithms such as those included in 4Woz.","The legal basis that makes working with algorithms/taxation models such as 4Woz necessary is the WOZ (Valuation of Immovable Property Act). Under this, the municipality of The Hague annually determines the value of all WOZ properties via a WOZ decision open to objection and appeal. The assessed value is substantiated with a valuation report that is available to interested parties. The municipality also implements the WOZ Act for its customers, including the National Tax Office and the Water Board. Data are supplied to the customers via the National Provision WOZ (LV WOZ).",,0.1.0,,,datashop@denhaag.nl,Dutch,,"The WOZ Act makes extensive use of basic registrations. The WOZ object is delimited on the basis of data on property recorded in the Basic Land Registry Register, BRK. And usage is based on natural and non-natural persons listed in the Basisregistratie Personen (BRP) and/or the Handelsregister (NHR). When delineating WOZ objects, the relationship is also made to premises and addressable objects from the Basic Register of Addresses and Buildings (BAG). Part of the tax application IBS also forms the Property Valuation Act (WOZ) basic register, which records the object, the interest (the tax liability) and the WOZ value. The WOZ sector model provides insight into the hundreds of data included in a tax application and valuation system such as 4Woz. It would go too far to write this out here. Two main groups of data are processed through the algorithm, First, these are object characteristics such as primary object characteristics (type of object, size, year of construction, outbuildings and the like), secondary object characteristics which are a qualification of e.g. location, maintenance, quality and appearance. The second group of data includes market data such as asking prices, purchase prices, rents, construction costs and land prices. These are mostly reduced to key figures. The algorithm then calculates the values of WOZ properties in components using object characteristics x key figures. The sum of the value of components is the assessed value, which is approved and delivered to IBS (Integrated Tax System) after verification.","In fact, algorithms are very simple mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division when calculating appraisal values from object characteristics and unit prices. The same is true when preparing valuation reports. More complicated sub-processes such as coding and measuring object characteristics and classifying objects into groups and the like is still old-fashioned manual work. This also applies to setting the unit prices used for calculation. The fact that algorithms are nevertheless applied in the form of 4Woz has to do with the fact that nearly 300,000 WOZ objects with a multitude of WOZ sub-objects and object characteristics) are valued in an annual process. In doing so, the algorithm helps to do this in a consistent manner to ensure as much as possible that equal objects are treated equally. ","Yes, certainly there is human intervention in the sense of the user of the application 4Woz. WOZ data managers take care of managing property characteristics in a consistent manner, WOZ valuers analyse market data in interaction with stakeholders (citizens and businesses). WOZ appraisers set up the models, which amounts to determining unit prices and setting the influence of object characteristics on the appraisal value. Finally, the outcome of the appraisal model is checked by WOZ appraisers before the WOZ values are determined. The 4Woz application is used in an annual process. In it, managing property characteristics and performing market analysis are continuous activities. After WOZ decisions are made in IBS within eight weeks after 1 January each year, 4Woz supports successively in a number of WOZ sub-processes. At first mainly in the handling of objections and appeals, in summer and autumn the emphasis is on the set-up of valuation models, in autumn the emphasis is on preliminary consultations with specific stakeholders and on large-scale checking of the quality of valuations. Within eight weeks of 1 January, the annual cycle is in principle completed with the re-adoption of the WOZ assessments. This is basically the way to freeze and formalise the outcomes of the algorithms. Until then, a WOZ assessor can continuously improve the WOZ assessment before it is determined as a WOZ value. The handling of objections is a formal moment to reconsider the outcome of the valuation model with the citizen or company.","For automated valuation models, risks include, in particular, a poor quality of object characteristics, insufficient or inadequately analysed market data, the set-up of the valuation models with key figures and a poor verification process of appraised values. The outcomes of 4Woz's algorithms depend on the quality of property characteristics, proper analysis of market data and the proper design of the assumptions of the valuation models. Great importance is attached at the front end of this valuation process to the professionalism of the WOZ data managers for an unambiguous and complete registration of object characteristics. Similarly, importance is attached to craftsmanship of the WOZ valuer for proper market analysis, knowledge of the market, design and operation of the valuation models and verification of valuations.

According to the WOZ Act, the interested party (owner/user) of a WOZ assessment can submit a reasoned objection within six weeks after the date of the decision, pointing out incorrect data.  As part of the handling of the objection, the grievances are assessed and the data underlying the WOZ assessment including the WOZ value are corrected if necessary.

As part of the application of the assessment protocols, market-level reconciliation is assessed on the basis of ratios and key figures, among other things.

It involves the coherent retrieval of objects, relationships and attributes of objects such as property, residence object, building zone, level, space and the flat right, among others. Coherent acquisition benefits quality (including completeness, consistency and accuracy). Higher quality reduces queries and coordination problems between e.g. (basic) registrations. The application eventually replaces measuring in a paper drawing or in a digital drawing with e.g. Bluebeam (where existing lines are redrawn).  A data manager or geo-information manager operates the application and can intervene in each of 13 steps to make corrections.

In fact, PDF2GIS itself is seen as an alternative to a traditional way of collecting building data. In a traditional way of working, individual municipal employees each make their own interpretation of lines and text in order to deduce building data. This involves proportionally fewer consistent interpretations and proportionally more errors, e.g. in calibration. The strength of PDF2GIS is the ability to collect data that are currently still kept separately in different basic registries in a coherent way. Current practice is that data in four different registries (WOZ, BAG, BGT, 3D city model) are not maintained simultaneously and from different sources. This is comparatively expensive (differences in feedback etc.) and the quality is comparatively low (due to differences in time, accuracy, precision etc.). There are no other programmes with algorithms that can collect building data in coherence, using existing, known building data, such as in the system of basic registries or the WOZ registration.","Under the BAG Act (about managing addresses and buildings data), among other things, the size of the residential object is measured, under the WOZ Act (about the valuation of immovable property) the size of building areas on building floors within the WOZ object.

The insights from the prediction model can only be used through human intervention and with the context knowledge and experience of employees involved. ,"The risks of the algorithm were identified in advance and during the construction of the prediction model. Because the prediction model does not make statements about individuals but about the use of facilities in neighbourhoods, there was no risk that the results from the model could violate the privacy of specific individuals. Furthermore, we only worked with neighbourhoods that were sufficiently large (more than 100 inhabitants) and where enough people used the Wmo (more than 100 users). One reason for this is that it does not allow for disclosure. That is, by combining characteristics, we cannot identify who the potential users of Wmo facilities are. Furthermore, when building the model, we weighed up together with the privacy officer which variables could and could not be included from a privacy perspective. Here, the AVG was always the starting point. In addition, explainability of the model and the results is a relevant and decisive criterion.

That conclusion may have been that the benefit was granted lawfully; or that the previously granted benefit did not match the actual situation (unlawfulness). Based on this historical data, a prediction can be made about the probability of lawfulness or unlawfulness among current benefit recipients. That prediction is thus made on the basis of the data of current benefit recipients known in our records. The outcome of the model is a 'risk estimation number' that varies between 0 (high probability of legitimacy) and 1 (high probability of illegality). The benefit recipients with the highest risk estimation number are invited for an investigative interview, unless, for example, a legitimacy investigation has already taken place recently. The number of benefit recipients to be invited is redetermined annually on the basis of the risk estimation model. The model is redeveloped every year, as new investigation data become available each year. Thus, information from recent investigations into legality are always taken into account when developing a new model. The municipality of Rotterdam has not been using this algorithm since early 2022. Our exploration of an improved 'risk model' showed that it is currently not possible to develop an algorithm that fits our policy. ","The model does not rule on legality or illegality: the investigation required for that ruling is always carried out by a staff member. That examination is always done in the same way, whether the benefit recipient is invited on the basis of the risk assessment model or one of the other selection methods.

One of these is a risk estimation model with a predictive algorithm. This justification provides an overview of the main digital data sources used in the development and in the application of the algorithm. The risk estimation model uses two data sources: 1. Socrates: Socrates is the benefit administration system. In it, the amount of benefit provided is determined and recorded. This system includes data on, for example, the housing/living situation of the benefit recipient. 2. RWM/Raak: RWM/Raak is the system in which data on the reintegration of jobseekers are recorded. It concerns data on the competences and qualities of the jobseeker that are important for his chances on the labour market, and the routes that are set out to increase the chances of employment. It concerns information that is recorded within the municipality in the context of the implementation of the Participation Act. There is no link with other databases.",,"The risk assessment model does not determine whether a person is receiving benefits lawfully or unlawfully. With the model, however, part of the determination is which benefit recipients are invited for an investigative interview. An expert income consultant from the Work &amp; Income Department of the Municipality of Rotterdam conducts this investigation. After carrying out the investigation, the income consultant determines whether the jobseeker's benefit has been granted lawfully or unlawfully and whether it still fits the situation in which the jobseeker finds himself.","To determine the risk of an algorithm, the municipality of Rotterdam uses an established classification model. The risk estimation model has been classified as a high-risk algorithm. The municipality therefore takes extra security measures. These include measures to ensure that there is proper supervision of the development and use of the model. These include specifically looking at the ethical risks and having an external oversight committee look at the design and use of the model. This committee is expected to be in place by early 2022. If there is an algorithm in the high-risk category, a human review is part of the work process in which the algorithm in question is used. The risk of bias is reduced because the risk estimation model is only used to determine who receives an invitation to a research interview. The algorithm does not determine whether someone is lawfully or unlawfully receiving benefits. This is done by income consultants from the W&amp;I department. They investigate the situation extensively, together with the benefit recipient. After all, providing benefits is tailor-made and is done on an individual level. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Cluster Werk & Inkomen,"For a family living on little money, an invitation to an interview is already very exciting, as it could have consequences.",,,,,,,,Rotterdam,,"In Rotterdam, everyone participates. Even residents who do not have sufficient income or assets of their own. They usually receive benefits from the municipality. The cluster Work &amp; Income (W&amp;I) of the municipality of Rotterdam regularly examines and assesses whether the benefit that residents receive is legitimate and still appropriate to their situation. Benefit recipients may therefore be invited for an investigative interview. To determine who receives an invitation, the municipality uses various selection methods, including a risk assessment model. This model helps the municipality to estimate in which benefit recipients there is a high probability that the benefit does not (no longer) fit the situation of the benefit recipient (illegality). This has two advantages. It helps the municipality avoid extensive recoveries. In addition, benefit recipients for whom the probability of illegality is deemed low are less likely to be invited for an investigation interview. The risk estimation model uses a predictive algorithm. This algorithm uses data that the W&amp;I cluster needs to perform its legal duties and to be able to provide the benefit. This includes data such as the amount of the benefit, the family situation, but also competences and qualities of the jobseeker, which are important for their chances on the labour market. The municipality only uses data from its own administration. The risk estimation model is only used to select benefit recipients for an interview. Based on the model, no statements are made about the lawful or unlawful provision of benefits. An employee of the Rotterdam municipality assesses the right to a benefit, as this depends on many factors and is also custom-made. The algorithm therefore does not make or prescribe decisions. The model is redeveloped every year because new survey data become available every year. Thus, information from recent studies on legality have always been taken into account when developing a new model. The municipality of Rotterdam has not been using this algorithm since early 2022. Our exploration of an improved 'risk model' showed that it is currently not possible to develop an algorithm that fits our policy. ",,Yes,,
TVL Risk model,Netherlands Enterprise Agency,"The algorithm is used to make an automated risk assessment for all Applications for Fixed Chargesgemoetkoming, prior to automated or manual granting and payment of the advance. ",Rule-based,Corona aid measure,,In operation since 18-12-2020,"With the deployment of the algorithm, decision making is accelerated so that as many entrepreneurs as possible can receive liquidity support on time. The algorithm speeds up decision-making for granting relief and it provides risk interpretation for manual flow.  ","In the TVL, the risk model (algorithm) is used to automatically check all applications against the scheme criteria and make a risk classification for improper use. Prior to the advance payment and before the final determination of the grant. This speeds up the decision-making chain so that entrepreneurs can receive liquidity support as soon as possible. 
The deployment of the risk model enables RFO to make positive decisions on large numbers of subsidy applications in a very short time, so that entrepreneurs who need fixed expense support quickly during corona lockdowns can get it. Furthermore, the risk model enables RFO to process only positive decisions without the intervention of an employee, allowing employees to assess the remaining decisions more quickly. A similar outcome without the deployment of the risk model was assessed as not feasible during the preparation of the scheme: it would require a large-scale scaling-up of specialised staff, which cannot be organised at short notice. Even if it had succeeded, the turnaround times for entrepreneurs would have been much longer without the risk model. ","Legal basis TVL scheme: https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0044808/2022-10-19 The House of Representatives was informed about the largely automated implementation through the following progress report, see: https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/documenten/kamerstukken/2021/03/22/voortgangsrapportage-tvl",,0.1.0,RVO-TVLRisicomodel,,"Voor contact over deze registratie neem contact op met RVO via het contactformulier; https://www.rvo.nl/onderwerpen/over-ons/contact/formulier onder vermelding van Bedrijf/instelling,  Covid-19: TVL/TOGS/ATE, of Overheidsorganisatie, Covid-19 regelingen.",Dutch,,,,"With each new TVL round (application phase as well as determination phase), the risk model is adjusted and resubmitted for approval to an interdepartmental advisory committee (rolling review), which advises the general director of RFO on the application of the risk model. Once it has been put into use, the risk model determines the qualitative and quantitative risk of each application; these factors together form the overall risk category. Category 1 is awarded automatically, from Category 2 10% falls out to manual and the rest is awarded automatically. In case the algorithm identifies an application as high risk, Category 3, it falls out to a manual check by an employee. For example, because the amount is high, the application is incomplete, or there are indications of abuse or improper use. The application is then readied for human review, and the algorithm gives advice to the clerk on what to look out for, such as data that is incomplete or contradictory. This can be useful: the advice helps the clerk get a quick picture of the situation. The clerk then reviews the entire application. The clerk can then approve or reject applications, possibly after a further request for information. A negative decision (no or lower grant) therefore does not follow from the risk model but always from an employee's assessment.

This algorithm tests whether an application meets the conditions set by the minister. This is done with the help of a risk model: when an application arrives at the RFO, an estimate is made whether the entrepreneur is actually entitled to the allowance. For this, the RFO compares, for example, the applicant's declared information with other data known to the government, such as declarations to the tax authorities. An application is automatically approved if the algorithm classifies the application as low risk, for example because the amount the applicant claims is low and there are no indications of abuse or improper use. In that case, no more employee is involved. The entrepreneur then has the money in his account within a week. If an application is deemed high-risk by the algorithm, for instance because it involves a high amount or because there are doubts about the declared turnover, a manual check follows, resulting in an extra processing time of two to three weeks on average - maximised to the Awb decision deadlines. In figures, 49% were decided within 1 week of receipt, 71% within 3 weeks and 96% within 8 weeks. Where abuse or improper use has been found in a previous application, future applications will always be checked manually. Even when an application is complex so that it cannot be assessed automatically, a manual check will follow.

Deep learning algorithm Traffic intensity model development Deep learning models are developed in the Keras library (version 2.2.4), an open-source neural network package written in Python. Keras allows researchers to quickly experiment with deep neural networks. Keras had been used in conjunction with TensorFlow (version 1.5.0) as a backend using the GPU variant of the chosen model (section 3) in the experimental phase. A grid-search had been applied parsed from the Scikit-learn machine learning library for Python. All analyses for data cleaning and traffic intensity modelling were performed in Python. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a set of algorithms inspired by the hugely efficient functioning of the human brain to recognise patterns. An ANN consists of artificial neurons and in recent years can be trained to far depth and complexity efficiently by so-called deep learning algorithms. For time-series data such as in this case study, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often a suitable solution because here neurons not only factor in information from previous layers of the network, but also include information from previous time points. A powerful variant of RNNs is the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network which was developed specifically to model long time series. In the work presented here, LSTM was chosen as the final algorithm to predict real-time traffic intensities for three bridges First, an LSTM model was trained on historical traffic data where a time series of inputs was used to predict a vector of steps ahead (script 1). In the second case, an encoder-decoder LSTM was used (script 2) where the input time series of data is encoded (encode). The decoder uses this encoded data and makes a prediction one step ahead for each element in the output sequence. The difference is small, as in practice both models predict one sequence ahead. The main difference is that an LSTM model encoder decoder model has information about both the previous step predicted and also the accumulated information from the encoder step is taken into account in predicting the output sequence",The algorithm itself is only decision support.

Selection aid WBU table,Province of South Holland,"Traffic managers want to be able to schedule predictable road maintenance based on workable hours. To carry out maintenance, traffic measures (in the form of partial road closures) have to be taken. This can adversely affect the road's capacity to handle traffic. 
Workable hours are determined by: -the capacity of the site; -the time of day (day, hour); -the minimum required residual capacity of the site; -the effect of the type of traffic measure on capacity. 

Workable hours are now determined statically. The aim of this phase is to determine whether we can determine these workable hours data-driven. 
The definition of data-driven in this phase is: maximum capacity of the location is determined by actually measured intensities (from NDW traffic data, with interpolation) at the same times. 
Using historical data, you can use this algorithm to see what type of closure and traffic measure can be applied to a road.  You can also see which times are suitable. The WBU table selection tool is partly used to draw up the WBU table. When drawing up the tool, certain agreements from the business community and other policy choices by PZH are also taken into account in addition to the tool.",Diagnostich,Roadworks and traffic,"De (tijdelijke) URL is: https://c6ae6fa2db7da44c79581d7e.azurewebsites.net/ 
Er komt nog een URL waarmee eerst via PZH netwerk moet worden ingelogd. Tevens is het (nog) niet de bedoeling dat deze URL door externe wordt gebruikt. In eerste instantie wordt de WBU doorvertaald in een tabel (zoas nu ook het geval is). ","Currently, the last teething problems are being removed from the tool (Nov, 2022)","Reduce operational costs and increase traffic safety -Increase traffic safety The CROW96b provides calculation methods to determine at which traffic intensity at which traffic measure may be applied. The current WBU table does not take this into account. Because a web application displays the WBU per type of traffic measure, the requirements from the guideline are always met. This keeps traffic safety guaranteed.  

-Operational costs Unlike the old WBU table, the web application makes it possible to calculate the WBU per day. Experience shows that the traffic pattern on a Wednesday and Friday is significantly quieter than on a Tuesday or Thursday. The case study below shows the financial implications of this. Our DBO contractor has scheduled mowing works throughout December in the Hoeksche-Waard. The work will be carried out in accordance with a half lane closure (Fig 1323b). The old WBU table indicates that the WBU is between 09:00 and 15:00. The web application to be created indicates that on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, work can be done from 09:00 to 16:00. This implies that the contractor can work an extra 3 hours per week. This is therefore 12 hours extra per month. By having an extra 12 hours of working time, the contractor will not have to hit the road as often. Assuming that the work is carried out through a pre-warning truck, action truck and end truck, this saves the rental and operational costs of three work vehicles and three drivers. This can save money. This is just an example of one contractor at work. Around 2,400 TVM applications are submitted every year. By applying the WBU application, a large proportion of these applications can probably be processed more efficiently and save costs.  
It is plausible, that thanks to the WBU web application, traffic congestion is reduced. This will also save social costs in the form of fewer vehicle loss hours.  ","Safety is increased as the CROW96B guideline is met, with less congestion and fewer vehicle loss hours.",The algorithm gives an advice/prediction.  But it takes into account the applicable guidelines of CROW 96B and APV (general local bye-laws) laid down.

This WBU table indicates within which time windows which traffic restriction measures may be taken by contractors, for the purpose of carrying out maintenance on Provincial roads. This table is based on knowledge and experience of supervisors and traffic managers. It is not numerically based. The WBU table is now not based on actual traffic situations. The result may be unnecessarily strict control (e.g. working only at night), while on some roads work can be done during a wider period. This can save on operational costs. 
The starting point should be: measuring is knowing. We measure on the basis of the actual busy streets and the expected nuisance caused. Figuring the table helps us, to have the conversation with stakeholders. 
In addition, the WBU now does not distinguish between the different types of traffic measures that can be applied. This means that there may be traffic measures on the road where, according to the traffic density and the guidelines from the CROW, this is actually not allowed. This can lead to traffic unsafe situations. A professionalisation effort is needed to ensure that the WBU table is substantiated numerically. By numerically substantiating our WBU, we can transparently indicate to stakeholders why traffic-restricting measures are allowed at certain times.
