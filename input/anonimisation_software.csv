Anonymisation software,Municipality of Someren,"The algorithm recognises (personal) data and otherwise confidential information in a document and makes a proposal to anonymise it. A staff member evaluates the proposal and makes the final adjustment, making the document suitable for publication.",Organisation and business operations,www.someren.nl,In use,"The municipality wants to be transparent to its residents and entrepreneurs but it also has to comply with privacy legislation, among other things. The deployment of anonymisation software makes this possible by supporting employees in anonymising documents.",The use of anonymisation software speeds up and simplifies the process for active and passive disclosure. Automated anonymisation is also less error-prone than human intervention. This reduces the risk of a data leak and better protects the data of residents and entrepreneurs,"General Data Protection Regulation (AVG), General Data Protection Regulation Implementation Act (UAVG) and Open Government Act (Woo), Electronic Publication Act (WEP).",1.0.0,,info@someren.nl,nld,,"This depends on the document being anonymised. Examples include personal data such as email addresses, phone numbers, bank account numbers, address details and signatures.","Smart features, such as set rules or templates, make it possible to anonymise per document or as a bulk. In this way, the method and degree of anonymisation of commonly used (standard) documents can also be set. The software then uses pattern recognition and Natural Language Processing to search for names, addresses, dates of birth, specific set words, signatures or regular expressions (such as e-mail, IBAN, BSN). The DataMask software recognises these and makes suggestions to mask or anonymise them fully automatically.",A staff member reviews the anonymisation software proposal before it is made final.,"The risks are minimal, as a staff member is always still assessing the result.",Datamask BV,,,,2023-10,,,High-Risk AI-system,"1: AVG, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0011468. 2: UAVG, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0040940. 3: WOO, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0045754. 4: WEP, https://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0043961","1: DPIA, uitgevoerd",
